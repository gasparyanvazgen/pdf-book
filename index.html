To Ken Blanchard, for teaching me and showing me how a true positive
leader lives and leads. Your example and support changed my life and I
am forever grateful.

CHAPTER 1
FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE
Being positive doesn't just make you better; it makes everyone
around you better.
I'm not naturally a positive person. People think I am because of my
books and talks, but the truth is that I have to work hard to be positive. It
doesn't come naturally to me. In fact, I find it ironic that I would write a
book like this—and that my life's work centers on the importance of
positivity. It's true that we teach what we need to learn. I know that my
quest to become a more positive person and better leader has made me
a better teacher.
I grew up in Long Island, New York, in a Jewish-Italian family; with a lot of
food and a lot of guilt; a lot of wine and a lot of whining. My parents were
very loving but they were not the most positive people in the world. My
dad was a New York City police officer who worked in undercover
narcotics. He fought crime every day and wasn't a big fan of positivity. I
remember waking up in the morning and saying, “Good morning, Dad.”
He would say in his thick New York accent, “What's so good about it?”
My dad was Al Bundy before Al Bundy was Al Bundy.
By the age of 31, I was a fearful, negative, stressed-out, and miserable
husband and father to two young children. My wife had had enough. She
gave me an ultimatum: Change or our marriage was over. I knew she
was right that I needed to change. I knew that I was allowing the stress of
life and the fear of not being able to provide for my family to get the best
of me. I told my wife I would change and began researching ways I could
be more positive. At the time, positive psychology was an emerging field,
and I read everything I could about it. I began to practice positivity and
write about the things I was doing. I met Ken Blanchard, who became my
role model. I began taking “thank you” walks to practice gratitude, enjoy
the outdoors, and feel grateful instead of stressed. This was a lifechanging practice that not only energized me physically, emotionally, and
spiritually, but also provided time for many profound insights and ideas to
come to me.

One of these ideas was The Energy Bus. In case you haven't read it, it's
about a guy named George who is miserable and negative. His team at
work is in disarray and he has problems at home. George was easy for
me to write about because he was based on me and my struggle with
negativity and adversity. George wakes up one Monday morning to
discover his car has a flat tire and he has to take the bus to work. On the
bus, he meets Joy the bus driver, who, along with a cast of characters,
teaches George the 10 rules for the ride of his life. Their advice not only
helps him become a more positive person, but also a better father,
husband, and leader at work. On one level, George demonstrates that
positivity is a difference maker in business, education, life, and sports. On
another level, George represents the fact that every one of us will have to
overcome negativity, adversity, and challenges to ultimately define
ourselves and our team's success.
Since The Energy Bus was published in 2007, I've had the opportunity to
work with many Fortune 500 companies, businesses, professional and
college sports teams, hospitals, schools, and nonprofits that have utilized
the book. I've met many amazing positive leaders and have witnessed
firsthand the power of positive leadership. I've seen how they have led,
inspired, and transformed their teams and organizations. I've observed
the impact they have had and the results they have achieved. I've also
researched many positive leaders throughout history and learned about
their paths to success. There is indeed a power associated with positive
leadership, and my goal with this book is twofold. First, I aim to explain
how and why positive leaders make a difference. Second, I intend to
provide a simple framework filled with practical ideas that will help
anyone become a positive leader. It's one of the most important things a
person can do because one positive leader will inspire many others to
become positive leaders as well. My daughter wrote her college
admission essay last year and it said, “When I was young my mom
struggled with her health and my dad struggled with himself. But over the
years I watched my dad work to become a more positive person. Then he
started writing and speaking about it and sharing his message with
others. I saw people change for the better and I know that if he can
change, and they can change, the world can change.” Her words brought
tears to my eyes because I realized that my one decision to be a positive
leader not only impacted my life but also my marriage, my children, my

team at work, and everyone around me. My hope is that you too will
discover the power of positive leadership in your own life. I know that
being a positive leader doesn't just make you better; it makes everyone
around you better. You can start today!

CHAPTER 2
REAL POSITIVE
We are not positive because life is easy. We are positive because
life can be hard.
It takes a lot of work to create a world-class organization. It's hard to
develop a successful team. It's not easy to build a great culture. It's
challenging to work toward a vision and create a positive future. It's
difficult to change the world. As a leader, you will face all kinds of
challenges, adversity, negativity, and tests. There will be times when it
seems as if everything in the world is conspiring against you. There will
be moments you'll want to give up. There will be days when your vision
seems more like a fantasy than a reality. That's why positive leadership is
so essential. When some people hear the term positive leadership they
roll their eyes because they think I'm talking about Pollyanna positivity,
where life is full of unicorns and rainbows. But the truth is that we are not
positive because life is easy. We are positive because life can be hard.
Positive leadership is not about fake positivity. It is the real stuff that
makes great leaders great. Pessimists don't change the world. Critics
write words but they don't write the future. Naysayers talk about problems
but they don't solve them. Throughout history we see that it's the
optimists, the believers, the dreamers, the doers, and the positive leaders
who change the world. The future belongs to those who believe in it and
have the belief, resilience, positivity, and optimism to overcome all the
challenges in order to create it.
Research by Manju Puri and David Robinson, business professors at
Duke University, shows that optimistic people work harder, get paid
more, are elected to office more often, and win at sports more regularly.1
Research by psychologist Martin Seligman also shows that optimistic
salespeople perform better than their pessimistic counterparts.2 And
psychologist Barbara Fredrickson's research demonstrates that people
who experience more positive emotions than negative ones are more
likely to see the bigger picture, build relationships, and thrive in their work
and career, whereas people who experience mostly negative emotions

are more likely to have a narrower perspective and tend to focus more on
problems.3 Daniel Goleman's research demonstrates that positive teams
perform at higher levels than negative teams.4 John Gottman's
pioneering research on relationships found that marriages are much
more likely to succeed when the couple experiences a five-to-one ratio of
positive to negative interactions; when the ratio approaches a one-to-one
ratio, marriages are more likely to end in divorce.5 Additional research
also shows that workgroups with positive-to-negative interaction ratios
greater than three to one are significantly more productive than teams
that do not reach this ratio. Teams with more negative interactions are
more likely to be stagnant and unproductive. The positive energy you
share with your team is significant. According to Wayne Baker, the
research he and Robert Cross conducted shows that “the more you
energize people in your workplace, the higher your work performance.”
Baker says that this occurs because people want to be around you. You
attract talent and people are more likely to devote their discretionary time
to your projects. They'll offer new ideas, information, and opportunities to
you before others.
Baker adds that the opposite is also true. If you de-energize others,
people won't go out of their way to work with or help you.6 Gallup
estimates that negativity costs the economy $250–$300 billion a year and
affects the morale, performance, and productivity of teams.
The research is clear. Positivity is about more than having a positive
state of mind. It's also a life changer and gives people a competitive
advantage in business, sports, and politics. While the pessimists are
complaining about the future, the energy vampires are sabotaging it, and
the realists are talking about it, the optimists are working hard with others
to create it. Puri and Robinson's research shows that our attitude helps
create a self-fulfilling prophecy. Because optimists believe in a positive
future, they actually delude themselves into working more to make it
possible. Their belief makes them willing to take actions to achieve it. As
a result, positive leaders invest their time and energy in driving a positive
culture. They create and share the vision for the road ahead. They lead
with optimism and belief and address and transform the negativity that
too often sabotages teams and organizations. They take on the battle,
overcome the negativity, face the adversity, and keep moving forward.

They devote all their energy and effort to uniting and connecting their
organization and invest in relationships that truly build great teams. They
believe in their principles. They believe in their people. They believe in
teamwork. They believe in the future. They believe in what's possible, so
they act and do, connect and create, build and transform their team and
organization—and change the world.
In the following chapters I'm going to take you through a simple, powerful
model and framework you can utilize and implement to enhance your
leadership capabilities and put your positive leadership into action.

CHAPTER 3
POSITIVE LEADERS DRIVE POSITIVE
CULTURES
Culture is not just one thing. It's everything.
Positive leaders drive positive cultures. I use the word drive here
because as a leader you are the driver of your bus and you have a big
role and responsibility in creating the kind of journey you and your team
will experience. One year I spoke at a school district and talked with all
their leaders, mostly school principals. I shared the same principles and
strategies with everyone. At the end of the year, I heard from two
principals from the district. One principal had given every member of her
staff The Energy Bus to read and followed up with staff meetings where
she discussed and reinforced the principles each month. She focused all
of her energy on creating a positive culture, one meeting, one
conversation, one interaction, one positive message, one teacher, and
one student at a time. She completely transformed the morale,
engagement, energy, and culture of her school. The other principal I
heard from was very disappointed and told me that she had handed a
copy of The Energy Bus to all her teachers, encouraged them to read it,
and wondered why it didn't have much of an impact on her school and
culture. I realized in that moment that you can give a team a bus, but
unless you have drivers, it doesn't move. It's not a book that makes a
difference. It's not a lecture or a keynote. It's the leader that makes the
difference. It's the leader that must drive the culture.

Your Most Important Job
Your most important job as a leader is to drive the culture—and not just
any culture. You must create a positive culture that energizes and
encourages people, fosters connected relationships and great teamwork,
empowers and enables people to learn and grow, and provides an
opportunity for people to do their best work. Culture is not just one thing;
it's everything. Culture drives expectation and beliefs. Expectations and
beliefs drive behaviors. Behaviors drive habits. And habits create the

beliefs drive behaviors. Behaviors drive habits. And habits create the
future. It all starts with the culture you create and drive throughout the
organization. That's where all success and great results begin.
Driving your culture is not something you can delegate. You are the
leader and you must spend your time, energy, and effort creating and
building the culture of your team and organization. Nancy Koeper, the
retired president of UPS for the Northwest Region, made culture her
number-one priority as she drove a positive culture through an
organization that was, literally, full of drivers. She wanted to improve
engagement and morale, so she rolled out The Energy Bus to the 1,000
leaders she led with the intent of enhancing positive leadership, positive
interactions, and improved relationships with the UPS drivers. Her
leaders all read the book, then discussed ways to implement the ideas.
They then rolled out The Energy Bus to their 11,000 drivers in the district
by simply focusing on positivity, positive interactions, and improved
relationships. I had yet to have a company measure results after utilizing
The Energy Bus, so it was exciting to hear from Nancy a year later. She
reported that engagement, morale, and performance had risen while
disengagement and absenteeism had fallen. Nancy drove the UPS bus
and it made all the difference.
Alan Mulally, the former CEO of Ford, led one of the most incredible
corporate turnarounds in history. In 2006, when he stepped into the CEO
role, the automaker had just suffered an annual loss of $12.7 billion and
was on the verge of bankruptcy. In just a few short years under his
leadership, Ford was back in the black and the company saw an annual
profit every year since 2009. Mulally credited this improbable feat on the
organization's focus on driving and building a “One Ford” culture that was
centered on the idea of “One Team” where everyone in the organization
was committed to the enterprise and to each other. A cultural shift like
this doesn't happen by accident. Mulally shared with me his management
system, a simple but powerful set of principles, philosophies, behaviors,
and processes he designed to create a culture at Ford that fostered unity,
teamwork, appreciation, transparency, safety, and even joy. I'll share
more of what I learned from Mulally, who defines his leadership as
positive leadership, throughout the book because he's one of history's
greatest examples of positive leadership and he demonstrates that great
cultures happen when positive leaders know their most important job is to

drive the culture.

Culture Beats Strategy
When Apple was just the two Steves (Jobs and Wozniak), they knew the
culture they wanted to create. They would be the culture that challenged
the status quo. Everything they did, including hiring people, running
campaigns, and creating products, was influenced by this culture. Even
after Steve Jobs's death, the culture continues to influence everything
they do. It's why Apple is famous for stating the maxim that “culture beats
strategy.” You have to have the right strategy of course, but it is your
culture that will determine whether your strategy is successful. I believe
Apple will be successful as long as they innovate and create from the
strength of their culture. If they lose their culture they will lose their way
and, like many of the mighty that have come before them, they will fall.
Very few people understand the importance of culture more than Rick
Hendrick, the owner and founder of Hendrick Automotive Group and
Hendrick Motorsports. In a world where there are thousands of car
dealerships and many NASCAR racing teams, Hendrick Automotive is
the largest privately owned dealer group in the United States, and
Hendrick Motorsports is the winningest racing organization in the modern
NASCAR era. Through speaking to the leaders of Hendrick Automotive
and Jimmie Johnson's racing team (owned by Hendrick Motorsports), I
have witnessed the incredible culture in both organizations. It's clear that
they are driven by the same person. Rick Hendrick's signature leadership
and drive are ingrained in everything they do. His people are humble,
hungry, thankful, kind, and appreciative. They are on a quest for
greatness. Their buildings are spotless. Their energy is always positive
and contagious. Everyone wants to be the best and win. When you
spend time with two companies—when you see the success of his
automotive dealerships and the Jeff Gordon, Jimmie Johnson, and Dale
Earnhardt, Jr. racing teams—you realize that culture not only beats
strategy, but it also fuels it and drives people and organizations to record
growth and performance.

Know What You Stand For

You might be wondering where to start when driving and building a
culture. I believe it starts with two questions: 1) What do we stand for? 2)
What do we want to be known for? While visiting Hendrick Automotive, I
asked several of Rick's leaders what they stood for, and they all said
servant leadership. They told me that Rick leads the way and, in doing
so, puts himself last in every decision he makes for his organization. He
is very focused on making sure everyone's voice is heard because it is
the team that shapes the company today, tomorrow, and in the future.
His executive staff knows that Rick expects them to serve the people
they lead in the same way. Teamwork through trust and respect is also
one of Hendrick's core organizational values. One of Rick's mantras is
“None of us is as smart as all of us.” He constantly states, “People are
our biggest asset! If we take care of our people they will take care of our
customers, and if we work together we will all accomplish more.” This
principle comes to life through weekly and monthly meetings where
employees share best practices. Having the high performers share how
they win in the market lifts the whole company.
As you would expect, Rick is all about integrity and doing the right thing,
doing what you say you will do, and being honest and telling the truth
regardless of the situation. Leaders at Hendrick Automotive and Hendrick
Motorsports also told me they have a passion for winning and don't give
up until they do so. Accountability and commitment to continuous
improvement help them improve individually and collectively as a team
and organization. They want to be known for their culture and winning
ways. They celebrate their past success and make it very clear they
expect future success. Yet, despite all their success, they are a culture
that believes in developing champions who serve others. They want to be
known for making a difference in the lives of others and their community.
Hendrick leaders are extremely selective in whom they hire. Only people
who fit their culture, embrace the same values, and possess a high level
of professionalism are added to the team. Because, as an organization,
Hendrick knows what their culture stands for, they are able to choose the
right people who fit their culture and who stand for the same things. They
also invest heavily to train and develop their people in order to sustain
success and retain their talent. Brad Stevens, the head coach of the
Boston Celtics, once told me that your culture is not only your tradition,
but also the people in the locker room who carry it on. When you have

people who fit your culture and carry it on, it comes to life in a powerful
way.
I've also had the opportunity to speak to Southwest Airlines a few years
ago, and they told me how consultants suggested they charge
passengers to check luggage since the competition was doing it and they
could make hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue.
Southwest considered their proposal but in the process asked
themselves an important question: Is this what we stand for? They went
straight to their purpose statement: “To connect People to what's
important in their lives through friendly, reliable, and low-cost air travel.”
They ultimately decided that if they were for everyday fliers and low-cost
air travel, they shouldn't charge baggage fees. You would think they
would have missed out on a lot of money, but a funny thing happened.
Southwest started to get new customers because the airline didn't charge
for bags. They ran advertising campaigns highlighting the fact that bags
fly free, and they gained market share in the process. Their revenue grew
to new heights. It's a great example that once you know what you stand
for, decisions are easy to make. When your culture dictates your
decisions, you are on the right path to positive results.

More than Words
Driving a positive, high-performing culture requires more than words.
After all, everyone has a mission statement, but only the great
organizations also have people who are on a mission. The greatest
mission statement in the world is pointless unless your people are on a
mission. When I speak to leaders, I always tell them that it doesn't matter
what core values you have written on the walls of your building and
website if you don't live and breathe them every day. Remember Enron?
One of their core values was integrity.
As a positive leader, you can't just show the way and talk about the way.
You must also lead the way. You must live your culture and know that it
is an extension of who you are as a leader. If you don't set the example
and live the values—if you aren't on a mission—your culture won't come
to life. The same goes for the people on your team and in your
organization. Everyone creates the culture. Leaders define what your

culture stands for, and your people define whether or not they stand for
your culture. Education expert Todd Whitaker says that the unwritten
rules in an organization are more important than the written ones. The
rules you set with your example are what your organization is really all
about, so make sure you live and breathe the values written on the walls.
Don't tell the world your mission statement. Show the world you are on a
mission. Then energize and empower your people to be culture drivers
and culture builders. Positive leaders know they can't do it alone. Culture
starts with the leader living it and inspiring and empowering others to live
it as well.

Positively Contagious
As a leader, the energy you put into your team and culture determines
the quality of it. Research from the HeartMath Institute
(www.heartmath.org) shows that when you have a feeling in your heart, it
goes to every cell in the body, then outward—and people up to 10 feet
away can sense the feelings transmitted by your heart.7 This means that
each day you are broadcasting to your team how you feel. You are
broadcasting either negative energy or positive energy, apathy or
passion, indifference or purpose. Research from Harvard University also
supports the idea that the emotions you feel are contagious and affect
the people around you.8 Your team is just as likely to catch your bad
mood as the flu and, on the flip side, they will catch your good mood as
well. As a leader your attitude, energy, and leadership is contagious, and
it has a big impact on your culture. Great cultures and teams are built
with positive, contagious energy, so it's essential that you share those
types of feelings. When you walk into the office or the meeting, or onto
the field, you have a decision to make: Are you going to be a germ to
your team or a big dose of vitamin C? Please know that you don't have to
be an extrovert to be positively contagious. Sharing positive energy
doesn't mean you have to be a rah-rah leader and bounce off the walls. It
means that from the heart you simply broadcast the love, passion,
positivity, and purpose that you have for your team, organization, and
mission. It comes more from your essence than it does your words.
When Winston Churchill was leading Great Britain during WWII in its fight
for survival against Hitler, people commented that Churchill looked 20

years younger than he did before the war. During Great Britain's darkest
hour, Churchill was energized by the seemingly impossible task before
him and his country, and he inspired his nation with passion and
contagious energy. His famous words and speeches were a
manifestation of his inner strength and conviction.

Create a Culture that People Feel
When I visited West Point in the summer of 2014, the USA Basketball
Men's National Team happened to be visiting at the same time. Head
coach Mike “Coach K” Krzyzewski brought the team there to understand
what it truly means to represent the United States of America. Coach K
knew the place was special. After all, he attended West Point, played
basketball there under Bob Knight, returned as the head coach after his
five years of military service, and coached there for five years before
becoming the head coach of Duke University. Coach K knew the players
wouldn't fully understand how special the place was by hearing him talk
about it. They had to experience and feel it. He said, “You can't talk about
this place, see a movie about this place, you have to feel this place. You
go to a place like this, you get it.” Coach K knew it was the same when
talking about service and sacrifice. The players had to feel it, so at the
beginning of their visit, Coach K brought the team to the West Point
Cemetery, where they had a meeting with family members of fallen
soldiers. The players on Team USA listened as the family members told
them about their children and how they died serving their country. The
players may have understood the concepts of service and sacrifice
before, but after seeing the graves of the fallen soldiers, listening to
personal stories, and feeling the loss of the family members, they truly
got it. It's also a powerful lesson for all of us. Feeling is more powerful
than hearing. You can't just create a culture where people hear about
what's important. You must create a culture where people feel what's
important. You must create a culture where people don't just hear your
talk but rather they feel your walk. When they feel the mission and also
hear about the mission, they'll be on a mission.

Invest in the Root if You Want the Fruit

If culture is so important then why don't more leaders focus on it? It's
because culture is not easily quantifiable. You can measure sales. You
can measure revenue, costs, profits, goals, wins and losses, outcomes
and results, but it's not easy to measure the health and strength of your
culture. Culture building also requires a lot of work, time, energy, and
focus to drive and sustain it. It's a lot easier to simply measure the fruit of
the tree than it is to cultivate the root. The world measures leaders by
their results, and this causes many leaders to focus only on the results
and outcomes, meaning, they focus on the fruit of the tree and ignore the
root. However, we know that if you focus on the fruit and ignore the root,
the tree dies. That's not my opinion. It's the truth, and we see it play out
all too often on sports teams, businesses, hospitals, schools, churches,
and families. If you want the fruit, you must invest in the root. If you invest
in the root, you will always receive a great supply of fruit. Of course you
should measure your fruit, but you should do so knowing that it's simply a
byproduct of how well you are nurturing the root. Your culture is your
root, and your focus should be on the process that nourishes and
produces the fruit.
In the book You Win in the Locker Room First, which I co-wrote with
Coach Mike Smith, we discussed how, during his first five years as the
head coach of the Atlanta Falcons, he was the second winningest coach
in the league, behind only Bill Belichick. But during the next two seasons,
he only won 10 total games. What happened? During the fifth season,
the Falcons made it to the NFC championship. They were one play and
10 yards away from going to the Super Bowl. They failed to make the
play and lost the game, and after that they became an organization that
only focused on getting to the Super Bowl.
During Mike's first five years as head coach, the Falcons were simply
focused on the process, the culture, the connections, and the
relationships in the locker room, including all the little things that made
them successful. But during the next two years, everyone in the
organization, including Mike, was focused only on the outcome. If they
didn't make it to the Super Bowl, the season would be considered a
failure by the media, the fan base, and many within the organization. The
pressure was on and everyone in the organization felt it. Mike says he
allowed that to steer the Falcons away from the very things that had

made the team successful during those five winning years. Mike said he
did a poor job of making sure the new members of the team, staff, and
organization understood the culture they had worked so hard to create.
Everyone learned the hard way that culture can change almost as quickly
as the momentum in a football game. Mike says he let outside forces and
pressure weaken their culture. The team stopped investing in the root
and Mike says the world watched as their tree withered. It was a lesson
he would never forget.

You Must Keep Building Your Culture
Mike Smith learned that a culture will not sustain itself. You must sustain
it. You must continue to build it, reinforce it, live it, protect it, and fight for
it. Positive leaders don't live in a Pollyanna world. They understand that
every day there are forces seeking to sabotage their culture and success,
and so they work relentlessly to keep it strong. I was recently giving a talk
at the American Baseball Coaches Association convention and Kyle
Stark, the assistant general manager for the Pittsburgh Pirates, was in
the audience. I shared how Kyle was obsessed with culture and always
looking for ways to strengthen it. When I saw Kyle after my talk, I
apologized for saying he was obsessed. He said, “It's fine. You're right. I
am obsessed. It's one of the things that helped us turn this organization
around from a perennial loser to a perennial contender and I'm not letting
up. I will continue to fight for and build upon what we have built.”
I've learned from many of these great leaders that you must invest in
your culture in such a way that it becomes stronger than all the forces
trying to sabotage it. I've learned that you and your team must value your
culture to the point that you will fight for it. I've learned that when you
create a culture worth fighting for and invest in your people to the degree
that they want to fight for your culture and for each other, your
organization will have the grit and strength to overcome the challenges
you face and become an unstoppable and positive force.

POSITIVE LEADERS CREATE AND SHARE A
POSITIVE VISION
It's important to have a compelling vision and a comprehensive plan.
Positive leadership—conveying the idea that there is always a way
forward—is so important because that is what you are here for—to
figure out how to move the organization forward.
—Alan Mulally
Positive leadership is all about seeing and creating a brighter and better
future. It's about inventing, innovating, creating, building, improving, and
transforming education, healthcare, business, government, technology,
farming, design, communities, cities, transportation, and every aspect of
our lives and the world we live in. Some scoff when leaders share bold
ideas, imaginative goals, and seemingly impossible dreams, but ideas,
imagination, and dreams are the fabric positive leaders weave together to
create the future and change the world.
At one time, Star Wars was just an idea in the mind of George Lucas, but
now the Force is as strong as ever. J.K. Rowling had a vision of Harry
Potter and now he's an iconic part of our society—and as real as a rollercoaster in Universal Studios. John F. Kennedy had a vision for sending a
man to the moon. Ronald Reagan saw the Berlin Wall come down before
it crumbled. Steve Jobs imagined the iPod and iPhone long before the
world was addicted to them. Abraham Lincoln envisioned a united
America. Martin Luther King, Jr., had a dream about equality. George
Washington had thoughts of revolution and freedom before fighting for
independence.
A positive leader sees what's possible and then takes the next steps to
rally and unite people to create it. Every invention, project, creation, and
transformation starts with an idea, an imagination, and a vision of what's
possible. History shows us that if you can see it, you can create it. If you
have a vision, then you also have the power to make it happen. Positive
leaders tap into the power of a vision and find a way forward. But in order

to rally people to follow you, you must be able to articulate and
communicate your vision in a simple, clear, bold, and compelling way.
Whether it's Ford's One Ford, IBM's Let's Build a Smarter Planet, GM's
Design, build and sell the world's best vehicles, Feeding America's A
hunger-free America, Alzheimer's Association's a world without
Alzheimer's, or Fort Bend Independent School District's vision to inspire
and equip students to create a future beyond what students can imagine,
a vision serves as a rallying cry that unites and ignites people. It's not
meant to be a novel as long as War and Peace or a paragraph filled with
buzzwords and jargon that no one understands, remembers, or cares
about. It's meant to be simple, memorable, compelling, and exciting.
Remember, Martin Luther King, Jr. said, “I have a dream.” He didn't
say,”I have a strategic plan that I think might work.”

A North Star
Doug Conant, the former CEO of Campbell Soup, told me the most
important thing he did when he became the leader of the company was to
share the vision. He said he shared it before every meeting. Whether the
meeting was just a few people or hundreds gathered for a sales meeting,
he shared the vision: To build the world's most extraordinary food
company by nourishing people's lives everywhere, every day. He told me
that he kept sharing and reinforcing the vision in order to align everyone
in the company and point them in the right direction. He didn't stop saying
it once he had steered the company away from the brink of bankruptcy
and into profitability. He kept sharing the vision over and over again,
letting everyone know where they were going and why they were going
there.
The vision a positive leader creates and shares serves as a North Star
that points and moves everyone in an organization in the right direction.
The leader must continually point to this North Star and remind everyone
that this is where we are going. Yes, we were here yesterday. Yes, this is
what happened in the past. But this is where we are going now. We don't
have a perfect set of plans because the world is always changing, but we
do have a North Star that will guide us. We don't have a perfect road
map, but we have a path forward and we have each other. Let's keep our

eyes on the North Star and keep moving forward.
Sharing a vision and a North Star is important because everyone needs
one. Everyone needs something to hope for and work toward. As
humans, we have an innate desire to be great and do something great.
We have a longing to improve and create a brighter and better future
and, yet, so often fear holds us back. Stress weakens us. Obstacles test
our resolve. Adversity makes us want to give up. A leader who shares a
vision and a way forward is a dealer in hope, a believer in the impossible,
a champion of what's possible, and a coach who guides and inspires a
team to keep improving, and keep moving forward.

A Telescope and Microscope
As a positive leader you will want to carry a telescope and a microscope
with you on your journey. The telescope helps you and your team keep
your eyes on your vision, North Star, and big picture. The microscope
helps you zoom-focus on the things you must do in the short term to
realize the vision in your telescope. If you have only a telescope, then
you'll be thinking about your vision all the time and dreaming about the
future but not taking the necessary steps to realize it. If you have only a
microscope, then you'll be working hard every day but set-backs and
challenges will likely frustrate and discourage you because you'll lose
sight of the big picture. You need to frequently pull out your telescope to
remind yourself and your team where you are going, and you'll need to
look through your microscope daily in order to focus on what matters
most and follow through on your commitments. Together they will help
you take your team and organization where you want to go.
A simple exercise I like to do with leaders at the end of my talks is to
have them each write down their big-picture vision for their team and a
zoom-focused action they will focus on in order to be a better leader. As
a leader, you can do this simple exercise with the members of your team
and organization. Simply have each person identify his or her vision and
one action they will commit to in order to achieve it.

Dabo Swinney's Vision

I've worked with Dabo Swinney and Clemson football for the past five
years. A few years ago, Dabo told me that the day after he was named
the interim head coach of the team, midway through the 2008 season, he
had an early-morning meeting with the board of trustees. He hadn't slept
much the night before and had a lot on his mind. During the meeting, one
of the trustees said his vision was that Clemson would create a program
that was like other schools that had great academics and great football.
Dabo was tired and wanted to say something but he kept telling himself,
“Don't say it, don't say it, don't say it.” In the end, he couldn't help himself.
He responded to the trustee and said, “Sir, I don't mean this
disrespectfully but that's not my vision at all. My vision is much bigger
than that. My vision is that we will create a program where all the football
programs you mentioned want to be like us. That's my vision.”
At the time, they most likely thought Dabo was just filled with a lot of
positive words, but he had both a telescope and microscope with him on
his journey. In 2011, he crystallized his philosophy that best would be the
Clemson standard. Everything they did on and off the field was about
excellence and being their best. Between 2011 and the writing of this
book, Clemson has won at least 10 games every year, made it to the
College Football Playoff (CFP) National Championship game two years in
a row, and won it this year. More importantly, in a Wall Street Journal
article ranking all the football programs by success on the field and in the
classroom, only Clemson and Stanford were featured in the top-right
quadrant of the graph, which means they are the two schools with the
highest achievement combining both academic and football success.
When Dabo showed me the article and the graph, he said it was what he
was most proud of. It was his vision from the moment he took the job,
and every day he and his coaches and team worked to realize it.
A funny story about this journey is that when Dabo became the head
coach, he asked his athletic director at the time for a television for his
office to watch game and practice footage. The athletic director told him it
wasn't in his budget and they couldn't buy him one. So Dabo went to the
store and, with his own money, bought a television, which he still uses to
this day. Sure the television screens are much more high tech than they
were in 2008, but this television is special to him. While wrapping his
arms around it in a joking way, he told me that if he ever leaves Clemson,

he's taking that TV with him. Fast forward to 2017: Clemson just built a
$55 million football facility with the latest training and recovery
technology, nap rooms, a bowling alley, swimming pool, and all the
televisions Dabo wants. The finest college football facility in the world is a
testament to the power of one person's vision.
Dabo, like most big-time college coaches, had a vision of winning a
national championship. When I arrived during training camp to speak to
the team before the 2015 season, Dabo gave me a t-shirt that said
“Dream the Dream” on the front and “15 for 15, January 11, 2016” on the
back. I asked him what that meant. He said it was a vision he had when
he woke up from a dream. “I had a dream we were going to play in the
national championship on January 11 and go for our 15th straight win of
the season. The vision is to win all 15 games we play, hence 15 for 15.”
At the time, I wondered who could be bold enough to put that on a shirt.
By the end of the season, I realized the same guy who was bold enough
to make those t-shirts was also bold enough to say that he would have a
pizza party at the Clemson football stadium (nicknamed Death Valley) if
the team made it to the college football playoffs. Well, they made it and
30,000 people showed up for the pizza party. At the time, when Dabo
said they would have a pizza party, he had no idea how many would
show up or how he would feed everyone. But like in the movie Field of
Dreams, if you build it, they will come. Pizza restaurants from across the
state came together to provide all the pizza and it was one amazing
party.
If you watched the 2015 National Championship, you know that Clemson
lost to Alabama and failed to make Dabo's dream a reality. But after the
game I sat in the locker room and watched an incredible display of
positive leadership that I will never forget. Dabo told the team that he was
so proud of them and that they just didn't make enough plays to beat a
team as good as Alabama. He went on to praise his team and all they
had accomplished and thanked the seniors for the legacy of excellence
they had left. Then he began talking about the coming year and how
excited he was for the future. He shared the vision for the returning
players and said, “We will be coming back next year.” For the next few
minutes he pulled out his telescope and shared what the future looked
like and all that they were going to do. I was blown away. Here, he and

his team had just lost the National Championship, and Dabo was already
inspiring his team with a vision for the future. In that moment he taught
me that positive leaders, despite the circumstances, obstacles, and setbacks, keep the vision alive and continue to share it to inspire others.
Dabo kept the vision alive all season and Clemson made it back to the
2016 National Championship to play Alabama again, but this time they
won with a dramatic touchdown with one second left on the clock. Talk
about a once-in-a-lifetime moment, a vision realized, a dream achieved!

Keep the Vision Alive
To understand the importance of keeping your vision alive, let's look at
marathon runners. The fewest number of people quit a marathon in the
first mile. And the second fewest runners quit in the last mile. I would
expect a lot to quit in the last mile because, by that point, they have been
running the longest and should be the most physically tired. But they
don't quit because they are so close to the finish line. They don't quit
because they can see the end in sight. They have a vision of where they
are going and they keep running towards it. It shows the power of the
mind and vision. The body should give up but it doesn't because the mind
sees the finish line. The most people quit a marathon in the 20th mile.
That is where they are physically tired and mentally drained. They have
run far and still have a long way to go. They lose their vision and so they
give up. When I speak to companies, schools, and organizations, I
encourage the participants to write down when they experience their 20th
mile. We all have a 20th mile. Then, I encourage them to write down the
words “Keep your vision alive” because if you keep your vision alive, you
won't stop. You won't give up. Like Dabo you'll keep moving forward and
inspiring your team along the way.

Make the Vision Come Alive
We've been talking about a lot of concepts and ideas, but my goal with
this book is not to just share principles and stories and philosophy, but
also practical ideas you can implement. In this spirit, one of the simple
ways to transform ideas and visions into results is to have a conversation
with the people you lead. You may be the leader of 150 people, 1,500

people, or 15,000 people, but for the purpose of this exercise you will do
this with your direct reports, and then each person you lead will do this
with their direct reports and so on and so on throughout the team and
organization. During each conversation, you share the vision and you ask
each person to identify what it means to him or her. For the vision to
come to life, it must have meaning to us individually. For example, before
I spoke to the leaders of Palmetto Health in South Carolina, I interviewed
a bunch of people who worked in their hospitals and asked them the
vision and what it meant to them. Amazingly, each person was able to
recite the vision and tell me specifically how it resonated on an individual
level.
After the people on your team identify what the vision means to them, ask
them what their personal vision is and how it can help contribute to the
bigger vision of the organization. Then ask them how you can help them
on their journey. What do they need from you to be their best? Finally,
ask them how they would like you to hold them accountable. If you have
an open and honest conversation like this with each person you lead and
continue to communicate and discuss their personal and organizational
visions throughout the year, you'll see the power of a vision come to life.
When people know how they are contributing to a bigger vision and have
a bigger purpose at work—and feel like their manager-leader-coach
genuinely cares about them—the research shows that engagement
soars. We will talk more about this later in the book, but for now consider
this a great way to share, discuss, and bring the vision to life, one person
at a time.

My Vision
I love learning and talking about the power of a vision because it's a
vision that has driven me to overcome all the obstacles I have faced to do
the work I do now. In 2005 I was on a plane headed to a speaking
engagement in Portland, Oregon. I was energized about speaking and
thinking about how much the three restaurant franchises I owned were
draining me. While reading a magazine, I came across an article that was
titled “How to Know When to Sell Your Business,” and I thought that
maybe it was time to sell the restaurants. On my way home, I read a

completely different magazine and came across an article titled “How to
Value Your Business When Selling.” I didn't think it was a coincidence, so
when I walked in the door of my house, I told my wife it was time to sell
the restaurants. The signs were clear. I was going to do what I loved and
focus 100 percent of my time and energy on writing and speaking. My
wife wasn't as excited and optimistic. She asked what would happen if it
didn't work out. I was only doing a few speaking engagements a month,
didn't have a best-selling book, and we certainly weren't going to get rich
from selling the restaurants. We could survive a year or two, but if writing
and speaking didn't work out, then what?!?! I told her there were no other
options. Somehow, some way, it was going to work out. And it was then
that my vision was born. I was going to inspire and empower as many
people as possible, one person at a time. Six months after selling the
restaurants, I was walking and praying because the writing and speaking
weren't going well and I was filled with fear and doubt. That's when the
idea for The Energy Bus came to me. When I returned home I ran
upstairs to my home office and started writing. Three and a half weeks
later I had a manuscript that I sent out, which lead to over 30 rejection
letters from publishers. The agent I had found told me I should consider
giving up on finding a publisher and just self-publish. In those days selfpublishing wasn't mainstream like it is now, so that route felt like a
letdown.
I thought about giving up, but I couldn't. I had a vision and I kept thinking
about it. A few weeks later while sitting in a Barnes and Noble and
dreaming about my own book being on the shelf, I saw several books
published by John Wiley and Sons and realized we hadn't sent my
manuscript to them yet. I asked the agent to send it to them, which she
did, and it landed on the desk of Shannon Vargo. Shannon had only been
on the job for a few months but she read the manuscript and decided she
wanted to publish it. It turns out she had a best friend with a husband
named George, the name of the main character, and she also liked the
story. I remember getting the call that they were going to publish it. It was
truly one of the best moments of my life. The publisher said they wouldn't
give me a lot of money for an advance but they could publish it in six
months. I was more than excited because I didn't care about the money. I
just wanted this book out there so I could live and share my vision.

When the book came out it was surprisingly a huge hit in South Korea. It
was a top-ten best seller there, but not one bookstore in the United
States would carry it. My vision was being tested. I decided to go on a
28-city tour to share the message about the book and, hopefully, inspire
and empower as many people as possible, one person at a time. I
mapped out a plan for the tour, drove cross country, and gradually made
my way back to Florida, one city at a time. My friend Daniel Decker, who
is still my business partner, called up local radio and television stations a
few days before I arrived in each city and tried to book me on their
shows. We planned a book signing or a talk at a local library or coffee
shop in each city. We honestly didn't have an efficient and effective plan,
but we did have a lot of hustle and grit. We said I was internationally
known, which was true since I was a best seller in South Korea, and,
fortunately, I was able to get on a bunch of local television and radio
shows, but only a few people showed up to my events. We had five
people in one city. Ten people in another city. We had a big crowd of 20
to 30 people in a few cities, and the biggest turnout was about 100
people in Des Moines, Iowa. I believe they showed up because they
thought Jeff Gordon, the NASCAR driver, was coming.
The tour wasn't easy. I had two young children at home with my wife and
I missed them a lot. I drove thousands of miles through the desert and
cornfields and mountains, and got sick along the way in Kansas and
Nebraska. Thankfully, Jim Van Allan, my college intern at the time, who is
now a great trainer, speaker, and workshop leader for my company, was
able to drive The Energy Bus and me to a few cities while I slept and
recovered. I gave everything I had on that tour and focused on inspiring
and empowering anyone who came to see me. The interesting thing was
that I met a school principal in one city and that lead to a speaking
engagement at a school. I met a businessman and that lead to a
speaking engagement at a company. I met a coach and that lead me to
speak to my first pro sports team. I didn't have a great plan, but my vision
kept me going and it lead to many of the great relationships I have to this
day. Ten years later, my vision still keeps me going. It's the reason why I
wrote this book, created Positive University, and started The Energy Bus
for Schools program, where our mission is to transform the negativity
prevalent in education to create positive school cultures and develop
positive leaders (both adults and students). I've experienced the power of

a vision in my own life and I know what is possible when you see it and
act on it. I don't tell you my story so you'll be impressed with me. I tell it
so you'll look inside yourself and look out into the world and know that
you possess the greatest power in the universe: the power to see a
positive future and create it.

CHAPTER 5
POSITIVE LEADERS LEAD WITH OPTIMISM,
POSITIVITY, AND BELIEF
The most important characteristic of a leader is optimism.
—Bob Iger, CEO of Disney
The research shows that optimism is a competitive advantage, but we
don't need research to tell us what we already know to be true. After all, if
you don't believe in your vision and where you are going, and you are not
optimistic that you'll get there, you'll be like the many who give up before
reaching their goal and dream. They give up because of the struggle, the
negativity, the frustration, the adversity, the fear, the rejection, the
naysayers, and the circumstances that seem insurmountable. They give
up because they don't have the optimism, positivity, and belief to keep
moving forward. But you don't have to give up. You don't have to settle
for the status quo. You can see a brighter and better future and work to
create it. Do you remember me talking about Rick Hendrick in Chapter 3?
He is the man who built both the Hendrick Automotive Group into the
largest privately owned dealer group in the United States and turned
Hendrick Motorsports into the winningest racing organization in the
modern era. Well you probably won't be surprised to know that he lists
optimism as his number-one key to success; faith comes in second,
attitude sixth, and enthusiasm tenth. Optimism, positivity, and belief are
the fuel that positive leaders need to keep moving forward and drive
results.

When Donna Orender was the senior VP of strategic development for the
PGA Tour, she helped the Tour forge a new path forward, launched new
tournaments, developed revenue models that didn't exist yet,
implemented ideas and initiatives that had never been done, and
exponentially increased television revenue and grew the popularity of the
game. How did she do it? The same way she uplifted, transformed, and
grew the popularity of professional women's basketball as commissioner
of the WNBA. Orender leads with optimism and has a system to build
collective belief in her team and organization. When she became the
commissioner of the WNBA, there was a lot of negativity amongst the
people in the corporate office. There was a feeling that no one cared
about women's basketball and a lack of belief that the organization could
be successful. But Orender saw the passion and optimism in the coaches
and players, and she believed in them and in the future of the WNBA.
Orender identified the believers and began building an optimistic belief
system around them. Then she showed proof of concept and early
successes to the next level of believers and got them to buy in and
believe in the WNBA's future. She focused on one success at a time. She
said, “You have to give people excuses to say yes. Some will be all in
based on what you say. Some you need to show.” For those who still
didn't believe, she had to help them leave, letting them know they weren't

in the right place. Orender said, “I always believe in what's possible.
There isn't a problem that can't be solved. There are often multiple
answers and you have to find the best one. This isn't Pollyanna positive.
You must not only be positive but effective too. You can be positive but
not effective. It's about deciding the highest and best use of our energy.
Once you decide the way forward, you execute.”
It's hard to find someone who exemplified the power of optimism and
belief more than Marva Collins. Frustrated by the bureaucracy and
inadequate teaching in public education, in 1975 she started her own
elementary school, Westside Preparatory School, in Garfield Park, an
impoverished Chicago neighborhood. There she taught children, many of
whom had been wrongly labeled as “learning disabled,” to read, write,
and study classical literature. The system said they couldn't learn, but
Collins believed that with discipline, structure, hard work, and positive
reinforcement they could, and many of her former students say she
inspired them to believe as well. She would often put her hand under
their chins, lift their heads up, and say, “You are brilliant.” One of her
students said when you keep hearing that you are brilliant, you start to
believe it. The television show 60 Minutes did a special on Collins and
brought a bunch of her former students back for a reunion. Many of those
who were told they had learning disabilities were now teachers,
attorneys, sales leaders, and successful college graduates. They are
living proof of the power of a positive leader who believed in them and
was optimistic about their future.

Believe It and You'll See It
People often say they'll believe it when they see it. But in order to see
results you have to believe they are possible. William Bratton was the
New York City police commissioner under Mayor Rudy Giuliani during the
’90s, when the city had a major crime problem. Many said it was a
hopeless problem that couldn't be solved, but they solved it. Years later,
Bratton was asked how he did it. He said he met individually with the
chiefs in each of the five boroughs and asked each one of them the same
question, “Do you believe crime can be reduced in your area?” Three of
the chiefs said no and two said yes. Bratton said, “Unfortunately, I had to

fire three people that day. Why play the game if you don't believe you can
win?”
Doug Conant faced a similar challenge when he became the CEO of The
Campbell Soup Company. At the time the iconic soup company was
likely headed towards bankruptcy or about to be bought by another
company. Conant said one of the first things he had to do after evaluating
the business and the company was fire 300 of the company's top 350
leaders because these leaders didn't believe Campbell Soup could be
turned around. They didn't see or believe in a way forward, so he had to
replace them with optimists who would help him transform the company.
Together, they focused on their new vision, created a highly engaged
workforce and culture, and produced a remarkable turnaround.

If You Don't Have It, You Can't Share It
Please know that I'm not saying as a leader that you should fire all your
pessimists. What worked for William Bratton and Doug Conant may not
work for everyone. Every situation is different. I'm simply providing
examples that demonstrate the importance of a leader's optimism and
belief in overcoming challenges and turning around negative, seemingly
hopeless situations. The fact is, if you don't have optimism and belief,
you can't share it. If you don't have it, you can't transform your team and
organization with it. It starts first and foremost with you. Before you look
at anyone else on your team and in your organization, look in the mirror
and ask yourself: Are you a positive leader? Do you believe? Are you
optimistic? Are you feeding others with the positivity they need to
succeed? Perhaps you are like me and are not naturally positive.
Perhaps you have to work at it. The great news is that you can cultivate
it. You can become more positive as a leader. You can feed yourself with
positivity so you can share it with others.

Feed the Positive Dog
In my book The Positive Dog, Matt and Bubba are two dogs living in a
shelter. Matt, who everyone calls Mutt, is really negative. Bubba is a
positive dog who teaches Matt an important lesson. He says that we all

have two dogs inside of us. We have a negative dog and a positive dog,
and they fight all the time. Matt asks Bubba who wins the fight, to which
Bubba replies, “The one you feed the most, so feed the positive dog.” I
based this story on an ancient fable about two wolves, but whether we
are talking about wolves, dogs, or humans, we all have a positive-versusnegative battle going on each day. Every moment and every situation
presents to us an opportunity to see and experience the positive or the
negative. Each day we can feed the positive dog or the negative dog
inside of us, and whichever one we feed, grows. So feed the positive
dog.

Talk to Yourself
Dr. James Gills accomplished the remarkable feat of completing a double
triathlon (two triathlons back to back with only a 24-hour break). Even
more remarkable is that Gills completed a double triathlon six times, and
the last time he did it he was 59 years old. When asked how he did it, he
gave the best advice I've ever heard. He said, “I've learned to talk to
myself instead of listen to myself.” He memorized scripture and would
recite it to himself when he needed a boost. Gills continued, “If I listen to
myself, I hear all the reasons why I should give up. I hear that I'm too
tired, too old, too weak to make it. But if I talk to myself, I can give myself
the encouragement and words I need to hear to keep running and finish
the race.” It's the same way with life. Too often we listen to ourselves and
hear all the complaints, self-doubt, fear, and negativity that lead to
unhappiness, failure, and unfulfilled goals. But just because you have a
negative thought doesn't mean you have to believe it. Many of your
negative thoughts come from fear and the truth is that fear is a liar. I've
learned that instead of listening to the negative lies, we can choose to
feed ourselves with the positive truth. We can speak truth to the lies and
fuel up with words, thoughts, phrases, and beliefs that give us the
strength and power to overcome our challenges and create an
extraordinary life, career, and team. Whatever comes your way, just keep
running, stay positive, talk to yourself (instead of listening to yourself),
and make sure you celebrate and raise your hands in the air when you've
reached your destination!

It's All How You See It
Another way we feed the positive dog is through our perspectives and
how we see the world. For example, while visiting with and speaking to
several major league baseball teams during spring training, I kept hearing
from players and coaches that baseball is “a game of failure.” After all,
even a Hall of Fame player will fail to get a hit two out of three times. And
most players will fail to get a hit three out of four times. A pitcher will give
up hits and home runs; fielders will make errors. Yes, baseball is a game
where people fail often. But I saw it differently and, when talking to the
teams, I offered a different perspective. I said, “I don't believe baseball is
a game of failure. I believe it's a game of opportunity!” No matter what
happened on the last play, pitch, or at bat, players get the opportunity to
make the next one great. In the words of Babe Ruth, “Every strike brings
me closer to the next home run.” It's the same way with life. Anyone
pursuing anything worthwhile will fail and fail often. I certainly have failed
many times, but when I look back I realize I wasn't failing, I was growing.
I wasn't failing, I was becoming. I've learned that you can dwell on the
past or look forward to making the next opportunity great. You can see
life as a game of failure or opportunity. It's all how you see it.

Tell Yourself a Positive Story
When tragic events like 9-11, the Oklahoma City bombing, or the attacks
on the Boston Marathon happen, we have a choice in the narrative we
tell after the event. Terrorists want us to tell stories of fear, despair, and
hopelessness. Yet New Yorkers, Oklahomans, and Bostonians decided
to tell themselves and the world a very different narrative. They told
stories of strength, perseverance, and resolve—courage, faith, unity, and
love. This is significant because the stories you tell yourself determine
how you respond to adversity and how you live your life. When Charlie
Ebersol, a television producer, survived a plane crash that killed his
younger brother, one of the first things his mother told him was, “You are
allowed to be sad but you can't be mad, sad. You have to have a
purpose and turn this into something good.” Ebersol said that this
perspective changed his life. He went on to sell his company, gave up all
the things he had been doing, and focused only on the things he loved—

which lead to him producing inspiring television shows and
documentaries. In television and life people get knocked down. Those
who see themselves as victims stay down. But those who see
themselves as heroes get back up and, armed with optimism, courage,
and faith, they move forward and take action to create a brighter and
better future.
The story we tell ourselves determines the life we live. In one of my
favorite books, A Million Miles in a Thousand Years, author Donald Miller
tells the story of a friend whose teenage daughter was rebelling, doing
drugs, and dating the wrong kind of guy. The dad decided he needed to
stop yelling at his daughter and instead needed to create a different
narrative for her life. He held a family meeting where he shared that they
were going to raise money and build an orphanage in Mexico. At first his
family thought he had lost his mind but then they all rallied behind the
idea. His daughter even got excited about going to Mexico and meeting
the kids there and posting pictures on her website. A few months later,
when Miller saw his friend again, he learned that everything had changed
for the better. His family was living a better story. His daughter broke up
with her boyfriend after he told her she was too fat. The dad said, “No girl
who plays the role of a hero in her story dates a guy who uses her. She
knows who she is. She just forgot for a little while.”
Those who study filmmaking know that in every great movie the main
character wants to achieve something, but must overcome adversity and
conflict in order to get it. And those who study life know it works the same
way. Whether you want to start a business, build a winning team, raise
great kids, provide safe drinking water in Africa, help the homeless, find a
cure for cancer, educate children, or create a more peaceful world,
adversity and conflict will be part of your story as you strive to achieve
your goal. But when adversity hits, you can choose to tell yourself and
the world a positive story and work passionately to create a positive
outcome.

Challenge or Opportunity
You can tell yourself a positive story by looking at the events in your life
as an opportunity instead of a challenge. There was a British study of 500

charmed people who seemed to have it all—wealth, relationships, great
careers, and happiness. When the researchers studied these charmed
people, they were surprised to find that every one of them had
experienced misfortune in their lives. On the outside, it seemed like they
had lived perfect lives, but every one of them faced challenges,
adversities, and hardships. Yet despite the various challenges, they all
shared the same characteristic. They all turned their misfortune into
fortune.9 In the midst of their struggle, they looked for and found an
opportunity. As a leader you must remember that events are going to
happen. Challenges are going to come your way. Your job is not to get
stuck in the mud. Don't sink to a lower level. Keep your head up. Look for
the opportunity and the good that is coming your way.
The Gallup Organization did a study where they asked people to name
the best and worst event of their lives. They found that there was an 80
percent correlation between the two events. Somehow the worst event of
our lives often leads to the best, if we stay positive, stay the course, and
keep moving forward.

Shark or Goldfish
As a leader, your perspective is very important because how you see the
world and events determines the world you see and how you respond. In
my book The Shark and the Goldfish, I share how the waves of change
are always coming our way and, when the wave hits, we have a choice.
We can resist change or we can ride the wave to a successful future. The
research shows that people and companies that thrived during the great
recession were the ones who embraced the change. Instead of being like
goldfish and waiting to be fed like in the good ole days, they embraced
the change and looked for opportunities to find more food. The key factor
in their success was their perspective, how they saw the change they
were experiencing. Those who saw it as a bad thing and resisted it got
crushed by the wave. Those who saw it as a good thing and an
opportunity rode the wave to a better future. I recently spoke about
thriving through change to all the leaders of a company that owns a lot of
local news stations. There was a lot of fear and resistance to the change
happening and how people are and will consume local news in the future.

The leaders now understand that change is coming their way, like it or
not, and if they embrace the change and find new business models they
will thrive because of it. They are now sharks and ready to take on the
waves of change and experience the ocean of possibility.

Think Like a Rookie
Over the years I've spoken to a lot of organizations and leaders that have
been infected by what I call the curse of experience. This is where they
long for the good ole days, complain about the way things are, and are
unwilling to change. They have allowed their past experience, good or
bad, to affect their present and future. I saw this a lot in real estate
companies during the great recession when I was brought in to
reenergize them and boost morale. Before my talk, companies often gave
out awards to the best producers, and I realized that a lot of rookies were
winning the awards. It hit me that many of the veterans with all their great
experience were so shaken up by the economy that they had become
goldfish instead of sharks. They had allowed fear to paralyze them and
circumstances to define them. They were complaining about the
economy instead of creating it. They had the curse of experience and the
antidote was to get them to think like rookies again. Rookies aren't
tainted by rejection, negative assumptions, or past experiences. They
bring an idealism, optimism, and passion to their work. They don't focus
on what everyone says is impossible. Instead, with wide eyes they
believe anything is possible. Rookies put their heads down, work hard,
stay positive, live fearlessly, and are naïve enough to be successful.
Rookies don't have experience. They don't know about the way things
were. They have no knowledge of the good ole days. Instead, rookies
create their good ole days right now. Regardless of how much
experience you and your fellow leaders have, I want to encourage you to
let your experience be a blessing, not a curse. Let your experience
provide you with expertise and let your rookie mindset fuel you with
optimism and passion. Mentor the rookies because, for all their effort and
energy, they do make mistakes. And yet, let them teach you how to see
the world through their eyes. Think like a rookie, forget the past, and
create your good ole days right now.

Defeating Murphy
I'm sure you have heard of Murphy's Law, right? Whatever can go wrong
will go wrong—and usually at the worst possible time. Unfortunately,
Murphy's Law seems to play out all too often and, when a series of bad
things happens, it can lead you to expect more bad things to happen.
Instead of hoping for the best, you start to expect the worst and act
accordingly. Football coach Gus Bradley, one of the most positive
leaders I've ever met, told me about a great way he helps his team deal
with negative events (e.g., a crucial interception, penalty, injury, bad
weather, etc.) and avoid the victim mindset that can accompany them.
Gus tells his team about this fictional guy named Murphy, whom the law
is named after. Murphy is a big jerk who wants to ruin their practice,
games, and season. He says that Murphy often shows up at the worst
possible time. But instead of being scared of Murphy when he shows up
they are going to tackle him. They expect to see Murphy, and when they
do they have an even greater expectation that they will defeat him. Life is
filled with challenging circumstances, but you can rise above them. Life is
hard, but you are strong. The struggle is real, but so is your ability to
overcome it. As my friend Erwin McManus said, “Greatness is never born
from easy circumstances. We can become stronger when the world
becomes harder.” So when adversity hits, don't run from it. Don't be
scared of it. Face it. Take it on and keep moving forward. Murphy is
tough, but you are tougher.

Inside Out
A big part of leadership and moving your team forward through
challenges and change is to understand that we don't create our world
and success outside in. We create it inside out. This means that your
circumstances and the events that happen outside you in the world are
not meant to define you. You are meant to define your circumstances.
The power is not in the circumstance. It's in your state of mind and the
love, passion, soul, purpose, and perspective that you lead and create
with. Let's take traffic, for example. One day traffic really bothers you.
Another day you are listening to a great song or podcast, you're in a
great mood, and the traffic doesn't bother you. Is it the circumstance

(traffic) or your state of mind that is producing how you feel? If it was the
circumstance, your response would be the same, 100 percent of the time.
Remember that it's never about the circumstance. It's not the challenge,
change, economy, election, adversity, or setback you are facing. It's
always your state of mind and your thinking that produces how you feel
and respond. When you see that the world has no power over you, you
will lead more powerfully in the world.

Distort Reality
You will also lead more powerfully when you realize that you have the
power to distort reality. We often think that reality is objective, but when
you understand how positive leaders have changed the world throughout
history, it becomes clear that a leader can define reality and distort it in a
positive way. Before there was an iPhone, iPad, iCloud, or Apple Watch,
there was Steve Jobs, a man with vision, positive ideas, and a realitydistortion field. In Walter Isaacson's biography Steve Jobs, he describes
how Jobs repeatedly convinced Apple employees that they could meet a
project deadline that everyone thought was impossible. Time and time
again they would tell Steve he was being unrealistic and there was no
way they could create software or hardware in the amount of time he was
expecting. Jobs's team said he distorted their reality from pessimism (or
some would say from realism) to optimism and, time and time again, they
accomplished what they had thought was impossible. His belief was
contagious and, as a result, Apple became one of the greatest
companies on earth. What could your team achieve if you shared your
optimism and belief with them and distorted their reality?

Leadership Is a Transfer of Belief
You may have thought that reality is the result of your circumstances, but
it's really a result of your thoughts and beliefs. As we have discussed,
how you see the world determines the world you see and experience.
Leadership is a transfer of belief. What you believe is possible, and the
beliefs you share with your team and organization have a big influence
on what you create, build, and accomplish. Pete Carroll, the head coach
of the Seattle Seahawks, is well known for his positive leadership style.
Carroll said, “The world trains people to be pessimistic. One of the most

Carroll said, “The world trains people to be pessimistic. One of the most
important things I must do here is make sure my players and staff believe
that tomorrow will be better than today.” In essence, Pete is saying that
he must transfer his belief and optimism to his team. He must remind his
players of the power that exists inside them to create the world outside
them. He must help his players be optimistic and hopeful in a pessimistic
negative and fearful world.
I saw the same attitude and leadership in Silicon Valley during the great
recession. While the rest of the country was going through the downturn,
the people who lead and work for the companies in Silicon Valley refused
to participate in the recession. They were too busy trying to change the
world. They were surrounded by a bubble of optimism. While companies
and businesses around the country were fearfully closing their doors and
people were losing their jobs and homes, Mark Zuckerberg was attracting
millions of friends on Facebook. Jack Dorsey was building and growing
Twitter one tweet and 140 characters at a time. Elon Musk was launching
the world's first electric sports car and rockets into outer space with Tesla
and SpaceX. Larry Page and Sergey Brin were transforming Google from
a search engine into a verb and a ubiquitous part of our lives. And
hundreds of other innovators and start-ups were changing the way we
communicate, connect, learn, read, search, interact, live, and work.
In Silicon Valley there is a bubble of optimism that is filled with a
collective belief that anything is possible. If you have a great idea, it gets
funded. If you are willing to innovate and work hard, the American Dream
is very much alive and available to you. If you believe and you can
execute and turn this belief into a reality, you can change the world. The
innovators of Silicon Valley are alchemists who turn ideas into gold.
Where others see what is impossible, they see what is possible. While
others see them as crazy, they see the future. When a new idea or
product fails, they come up with a better idea and a better business.
Failure is accepted as a part of innovation and growth. Ideas are tested
and the best ones win. Silicon Valley embodies the can-do spirit,
creativity, drive, and courage that positive leaders embrace to create
innovations that change the world. But you don't have to live in the valley
to embrace their approach. Amazon and Starbucks have transferred that
spirit of belief to Seattle. Zappos has found happiness in Las Vegas. GM,

Ford, and the big auto companies are powering forward with new ideas
and making world-class cars in Detroit. And thousands of start-ups
located in cities and universities around the planet are dreaming of ways
to change the world. Every business and leader, wherever they are
located, can create a bubble of optimism and transfer their belief to their
team, tribe, organization, community, city, and following. There is always
a new idea or a better way of doing something waiting for someone to
implement it. It can be you!

Lead with Faith Instead of Fear
Ultimately, being a positive leader is all about leading with faith in a world
filled with cynicism, negativity, and fear. The ultimate battle we face every
day is the battle between faith and fear. As a leader you must realize that
your people are facing this battle daily. They are filled with fear, doubt,
and uncertainty, and it's your job to inspire them with faith. Leading with
optimism, positivity, and belief comes down to leading with faith instead
of fear. In the beginning of this book, I shared how positive leaders are
the ones who change the world. I shared how the future belongs to those
who believe in it and have the belief, resilience, positivity, and optimism
to overcome all the challenges in order to create it. But we know that
positive leaders don't do it alone. They do it with others, with the team
they build and the people they inspire, encourage, and lead with faith on
the journey.
A few years after Alan Mulally became the CEO of Ford, the economy
went into a tailspin, the great recession hit, and they faced the worst
economic climate since the Great Depression. There were many
moments where it looked like all the work Mulally, his team, and
employees had done to restructure the company, build a united
leadership team, create best-of-class automobiles, and become profitable
was for naught. At the bottom of the recession when things looked the
most bleak the government bailed out Ford's competitors and the rules of
the game seemed to change. Mulally told his team, “You have to expect
the unexpected and you have to deal with it. Whining is not a plan.
Wallowing is not a plan. We have a plan, and if we need to adjust it, we
will.” Despite his team members' fears, Mulally remained steadfast in his

belief in his plan, in his team, and in Ford's future. Where others might
have waffled and crumbled from fear, Mulally was an optimist who
continued to share his belief with his team and company. When the
economy finally turned around, his optimism, faith, and plan produced
exponential growth and profits for Ford. Without his leadership, this
wouldn't have happened.

Be an Over-Believer
Dabo Swinney was asked recently if he considered himself an
overachiever for all the success he has generated at Clemson. He
responded, “I'm not an overachiever. I'm an over-believer.” When Dabo
became the head coach of Clemson, he put a sign in the team meeting
room that said “Believe” because he knew there wasn't a lot of belief—
either inside or outside the program—that they could be great. Clemson
was known for losing games they should win. It happened to them so
often, people called it “Clemsoning.” So the man who had never been a
head coach or coordinator, whose father left when he was young, who
was homeless for a time growing up, who had left coaching for a few
years to pursue a career in real estate, who had believed in himself
enough to become a walk-on at Alabama and had come to believe that
anything was possible knew his number-one priority was to inspire his
team to believe—and he did. Dabo is so full of genuine belief and faith
that he shares it with everyone around him. He believes in his players
more than they believe in themselves. He believes in them so much that
their belief in themselves rises. Most of all I've noticed that, regardless of
the circumstance, no matter the challenge, whatever the setback, he
never stops believing and sharing his belief with his team. On January 9,
2017, I was in the locker room with the team at halftime of the National
Championship game. Clemson was trailing 14–7. Dabo told his team,
“Somehow, someway, we are going to win this game, guys. I don't know
how, but we are going to win.” The guys may have been fearful but Dabo
instilled them with faith. It was something he had done every day since
2008. With every setback and failure over the years, Dabo would say,
“God doesn't say oops. God doesn't make mistakes. There is a bigger
plan. Trust in it.” Dabo told me he was constantly inspired by Galatians
6:9, “Let us not become weary in doing good for at the proper time we will

reap a harvest if we do not give up.” He led with faith and his team acted
with fearlessness and reaped a harvest at the proper time.

Don't Stop Believing
Great teams are collectively positive. They have a collective belief and
contagious optimism—and it starts with you. When you believe, you can
inspire others to believe. When you have faith, you can inspire others
with it. You will face a lot of adversity, resistance, and negativity, but
always remember that your certainty, optimism, belief, and faith must be
greater than all the negativity, fear, and doubt. Share your optimism,
belief, and faith with your team. Show them the way forward. Point them
toward your North Star. Explain where you are going and why you are
going there. Talk about the challenges but explain why you can
overcome them. Transfer your belief to them. Feed them with positivity.
Speak life into them. Believe in them when they don't believe in
themselves. Lift them up when they are down. Inspire them to do more,
give more, and become more than they ever thought possible. Tell them
that fear and faith have one thing in common. They both believe in a
future that hasn't happened yet. Fear believes in a negative future. Faith
believes in a positive future. If neither has happened yet, why wouldn't
we choose to believe in a positive future? Why wouldn't we choose to
believe our best days are ahead of us, not behind us. Tell your team that
if you believe your best days are behind you, they are. If you believe your
best days are ahead of you, they are. What we believe matters, so let's
believe, work hard, and make it happen.
Even after Clemson won the National Championship, Dabo told the team
in the locker room, “You are National Champions now, but I want you to
be champions in life too. Be great husbands and fathers. This won't be
the best thing to happen in your life. God has even more in store for you.
The best is yet to come.” They had just reached the peak of success as a
team and Dabo was talking about their future as men. In essence, he
was saying whether you win or lose, don't stop believing. That's
leadership.

Your Leadership Journey

I don't know where you are on your leadership journey. I know that I
wasn't always positive and I've become a more positive leader over the
years. Perhaps you are already very optimistic and positive. Or maybe
you've been a pessimist or someone who says, “I'm just being realistic.”
Hopefully you understand that leadership is not just about what you do
but what you can inspire, encourage, and empower others to do.
Regardless of your circumstances and challenges, there is a future
waiting to be created and, with your leadership, optimism, belief, and
faith, your team and organization will be the one to create it. On your
leadership journey, it will take all your optimism, belief, and positivity to
help others become all that they are meant to be. It will also require your
ability to develop relationships with them, which we will discuss later in
the book. But if you start the process by building a positive culture,
sharing the vision, feeding yourself with positivity, creating your own
reality-distortion field, and leading with optimism, you and your team will
be well on your way to creating a positive future.

CHAPTER 6
POSITIVE LEADERS CONFRONT, TRANSFORM,
AND REMOVE NEGATIVITY
Being positive won't guarantee you'll succeed but being negative will
guarantee you won't.
Positive leadership is not just about feeding the positive, but also about
weeding out the negative. As a leader you must recognize that negativity
exists and you can't ignore it. One of the biggest mistakes leaders make
is that they ignore the negativity within their team and organization. They
allow it to breed and grow, and it eventually sabotages the team and
organization. You must address the negativity. Confront it, transform it, or
remove it.
I remember getting a call in 2007, shortly after The Energy Bus was
published, from Jack Del Rio, who was the head coach of the
Jacksonville Jaguars at the time. A friend had given him the book; he
read it, and called to ask if I would meet with him. Keep in mind that I had
just written the book. It wasn't in U.S. bookstores yet, although it was big
in South Korea. I had never worked with a sports team before, never
mind a professional sports team, and never spoken to a leader of his
stature before. Now, as I sat across from him he told me that he was
allowing energy vampires to get to him and the book helped him realize
that he needed to deal with the negativity. It also reminded him to be
more positive than the negativity he was facing. He asked me to speak to
the team, and for some reason I boldly said I would if he gave the players
a copy of the book. He agreed, and as I drove home it was confirmation
that everyone, even legendary football players, great coaches, and worldclass leaders deal with the same negativity that we all need to overcome.
Thankfully, I had written something that would help them. Looking back, I
believe the reason why The Energy Bus has been read by so many
leaders and teams is because it addresses the negativity every team,
organization, and leader will face. It was a lesson I had learned in my
own life before I wrote the book.

Your Positivity Must Be Greater than All the
Negativity
I remember telling my dad that I was going to be a writer and speaker,
that I had found my calling. His response was, “What the heck do you
want to do that for? That won't amount to anything. That's a load of junk.
Just focus on your restaurants.” He used other words I can't print. At the
time, I still owned a few restaurant franchises and my father thought I
should just focus on that. A restaurant was practical. Writing and
speaking was just a fantasy. A few years after my dad gave me his
“encouraging” advice, I appeared on the Today Show. The episode was
called “Get Energized Today.” It was my first time on national television
and I was terrified. I coached several people on the show about having
more energy and optimism for their life and work and, as I walked out of
the studio, my dad called me on the phone. He said, “Your mother and I
just saw you on television. You really made a difference. We are so
proud of you. We always knew you could do it.” I knew my dad didn't
remember being negative in the past and I realized in that moment that
every one of us will deal with negativity and naysayers on our journey.
Not everyone will have the same vision as you. Not everyone will believe
in your dreams. Not everyone will get on your bus. But to succeed, your
positive energy must be greater than all the negativity.
Gandhi said, “I will not let anyone walk through my mind with their dirty
feet,” and neither should you. You may have a negative team. You may
have negative customers, patients, neighbors, or parents. The first rule of
thumb when weeding the negative is to not let it bring you down. Be more
positive than the negativity you face. Don't be afraid of it. Negativity is like
a barking dog. It seems powerful, but when you look right in its eyes, it
runs away. Negativity is no match for your courage and positivity. I know
because I've worked with many positive leaders and watched how they
have confronted, transformed, and removed the negativity and achieved
amazing results.

No Energy Vampires Allowed
In 2011 Mark Richt, the head football coach of the University of Georgia

at the time, had his team read The Energy Bus and invited me to speak
to the team. I spoke before the season and, unfortunately, they lost their
first two games. Georgia had been underperforming during the previous
few seasons and the media was reporting that Richt was on the hot seat
and would lose his job if this season didn't go well. I texted him after the
second loss and said “I am sorry I didn't help more. I believe in this team.
I believe you all are going to turn it around.” Richt texted me back and
said, “Jon, the guys are still on the bus. In years past we've allowed
energy vampires to ruin this team but not this year. This year we won't
allow it.” In the team meeting room, Richt had an artist draw a large
picture of an energy vampire on the wall facing the seats where the
players sit. If a player or coach acted like an energy vampire, the team
took his picture from the media guide and put it on the wall. No one
wanted to be on the wall. It was a message from Richt to his team that
they would stay positive through their adversity and challenges. It
worked, and the team went on to win the next 10 games in a row and
made it to the SEC Championship.

Why Wait?
I shared this story with the University of Tennessee football team a few
years after working with UGA and, when I was finished speaking, coach
Butch Jones told the team the meeting was over but then called out the
names of 10 guys and told them to stay. I asked Butch who these guys
were and he said, “Oh, these are our energy vampires.” I said, “Oh, you
are going to deal with that now?” He said, “Yes. Why wait?” After the
meeting, Butch walked out of the room and into the hallway where I was
speaking to the athletic director. I asked him how it went. He said,
“Powerful. Most of the guys admitted they were being energy vampires
and have committed to being a positive influence on our team. They are
going to be difference makers for us this season. But a few of the guys
don't get it, won't change, and we will have to let them off the bus.”
Tennessee overcame a lot of adversity that season and made their first
bowl game in years. They were a great example how a team that stays
positive together wins together. I'll never forget Butch's words: “Why
wait?” To build a winning team you must create a positive culture where
negativity can't breed and grow, and the sooner you start confronting,

transforming, weeding, and removing it from your team, the stronger and
more positively contagious your culture and team will be.

The First Step Is to Transform
The first step in dealing with an energy vampire on your team is not to
remove but to transform. No one really wants to be an energy vampire.
These people are likely negative for a reason. The first steps should
always be to listen with empathy and love, and try to understand and
transform. For example, Martin, a leader with the company Seventh
Generation, told me that he put a sign on his door that said Energy
vampires welcome. Expect to be transformed. He had a lot of great
conversations and was able to transform a lot of negative energy into
positive results.
Richt also had a number of his players come to his office and tell him
they weren't going to be energy vampires anymore. Several of the
players from that team are thriving in the NFL. Several have become
successful businessmen and it's rewarding to hear how the experience
was a defining moment for a bunch of them. Mark didn't just kick them off
the bus. He confronted the negativity, invited them onto the bus, sought
to transform them—and it worked.

Start at the Culture Level
I have found that the best way to deal with energy vampires in your
organization is at the culture level, where you set the expectation that
people who drain the energy of others will not be tolerated. You talk
about the negative impact of negativity. You explain that one person can't
make a team but one person can break a team. You talk about what a
great culture looks like and how you want everyone to be a positive
contributor to it. You make it clear what a great team looks like, and it
doesn't look like a bunch of energy vampires. By putting the energy
vampires' pictures on the wall, Richt was in essence telling his team, “We
will not allow negativity to sabotage our team and goals.” Shawn
Eichhorst did the same thing by putting a “No energy vampires allowed”
sign above his office door when he became the new athletic director at

Nebraska. He wasn't shunning people, but rather letting them know he
was building a positive culture and wouldn't allow negativity to sabotage
their university and athletic programs. He faced a barrage of negativity in
his early years but slowly and steadily built his culture with a positive,
principles-based approach and transformed many hearts and minds
along the way. I've worked with Eichhorst and Nebraska Athletics for five
years and have witnessed the effectiveness of his approach. I've also
heard from a number of school principles and business leaders who have
addressed negativity at the culture level as well. While they didn't utilize
Richt's strategy of putting energy vampires' pictures on the wall (I think
they made the right choice, by the way), they made it clear in staff
meetings, book discussions, and viewings of some of our videos, that
negativity drains others and sabotages team performance. It is not
acceptable. This works wonders for most people in an organization.
When you feed the positive and create a culture where energy vampires
are uncomfortable being negative, they will either change or walk off the
bus themselves. Whether they stay and become positive or leave and
stay negative, you will have improved your culture and moved your team
in the right direction.

Remove the Negativity
But what if the energy vampires don't leave? What if they remain energy
vampires and stay on the bus? I see this all the time. Not everyone is
willing to change. No matter how much you try to help someone
transform and grow there will be some who are negative no matter what
you do. I heard from a school principal who invited all of her staff on the
Energy Bus. She shared her vision for the road ahead and asked who
was all in. All but two teachers bought in. She did everything she could to
get those two teachers to be positive contributors. She documented and
documented and documented, which you have to do for legal and
personnel reasons, and eventually she had to let them off the bus. She
told me that now they are on another bus somewhere else and her staff
is feeling more positive and energized than ever. Two negative teachers
were infecting their culture and mission to impact the lives of children. But
since they were removed, the culture, morale, and energy has improved
dramatically. If transforming the negativity doesn't work, you must
remove it. Your job as a leader is to create an environment where your

remove it. Your job as a leader is to create an environment where your
people can do their best work without being affected by an energy
vampire. You have to feed and weed, weed and feed.

Sooner or Later
I'm often asked how soon an energy vampire should be removed. How
soon is too soon or how late is too late? I can't give you a definitive
answer. Every situation is different. When I owned a few restaurants, I
definitely kept a few energy vampires on my team longer than I should
have. I had one manager at a store that wasn't doing very well. Sales
kept dropping and since it was the location furthest from my home, I
spent the least amount of time there. I decided to sell that location to a
friend and former manager who lived in the area and wanted to open his
own place. I had a meeting with the negative manger to let him know
what was going on and to reassure him that I had found him another job
managing another franchise owned by the other franchisee in town. I
wanted to make sure he was taken care of. I'll never forget what he said
to me. “You know, Jon, I think I'm going to use this opportunity to get out
of the restaurant business because I hate this f—in' job. I smile at the
customers like you ask me to, but I hate every single one of them.” I sure
didn't do a good job of hiring a positive leader for that location and,
looking back, I knew he wasn't a good manager, but I honestly have
trouble letting people go. If I could do it again I would have let him go
sooner. Yet, there were also times I kept people I probably shouldn't
have and eventually helped them transform. That's why there's no perfect
answer here, but it's something you should continue to evaluate and think
about as you lead your team and organization and deal with energy
vampires.
One other note on this topic: Even if you let someone off the bus, it
doesn't mean you have to let them out of your life. I tell college coaches
all the time that even if you have to remove a player from the team, you
should still try to invest in that player to help him transform and turn his
life around. You may have to let people go for a variety of reasons,
because they are hurting the team, but you can still find ways to invest in
them and help them grow.

Lead from Where You Are
One of the most frequent types of emails I receive come from people who
tell me they are emerging leaders in an organization but, since they don't
have the power to hire and fire, they want to know what they should do
with the energy vampires they work or interact with at work. I tell them the
same thing I wrote in the beginning of this chapter. The first rule is to be
more positive than the negativity you face. Become a positive force of
positive energy that demonstrates to others what real positivity in the
form of love, patience, kindness, and care looks like. Lead by example
and lead from where you are. Look at every energy vampire as an
opportunity to strengthen your positivity. I try to do this with my teenagers
and it has made me a much better leader. We are all on a leadership
journey and the first step in becoming a better leader is becoming a
better you. Learning to stay positive when surrounded by negativity is a
great training ground and, as you develop your own positivity and ability
to deal with energy vampires, you will grow as a person and leader. You
may not be driving the big bus and deciding who is on it, but you can
make your bus great and let it serve as a model for other leaders and
people in the organization.

Implement the No Complaining Rule
I didn't invent the rule. I discovered it while having lunch with Dwight
Cooper, a tall, thin, mild-mannered former basketball player and coach
who had spent the last 15 years building and growing a company he cofounded into one of the leading nurse staffing companies in the world.
Cooper's company, PPR, had been named one of Inc. magazine's
“Fastest-Growing Companies” several times, but on the day we met, it
had been named one of the best companies to work for in the country,
and Cooper was sharing a few reasons why. Cooper told me about the
no complaining rule. He said he had read The Energy Bus and realized
that, while energy vampires can sabotage your business and team, so
can subtle negativity in the form of complaining.
Cooper compared energy vampires to a kind of topical skin cancer. They
don't hide. They stand right in front of you and say, “Here I am.” As a
result, you can easily and quickly remove them. Far more dangerous is

the kind of cancer that is subtle and inside your body. It grows hidden
beneath the surface, sometimes slow, sometimes fast, but either way, if
it's not caught, it eventually spreads to the point where it can and will
destroy the body. Complaining is this kind of cancer to an organization,
and Cooper had seen it ruin far too many good companies. He was
determined not to become another statistic, and the no complaining rule
was born.
The rule is simple: You are not allowed to complain unless you also offer
one or two possible solutions. Cooper said, “We introduced the rule to
everyone in the company and now share it during interviews with people
who want to join our team. We let them know that if you are a complainer
this isn't the right place for you. If you want to focus on solving problems,
then we would love to have you and will surely listen to you.”
I knew Cooper's idea was brilliant. The no complaining rule was a great
way to weed out the energy vampires and turn negative energy into
positive solutions. I had to share it with others, so I wrote a book called
The No Complaining Rule to spread the idea. I explained that the goal of
the no complaining rule is not to eliminate all complaining. It aims to stop
the mindless, chronic complaining that fosters negativity and doesn't help
anyone. And the bigger goal is to turn justified complaints into positive
solutions. After all, every complaint represents an opportunity to turn
something negative into a positive. We can utilize customer complaints to
improve our service. Employee complaints can serve as catalysts for
innovation and new processes. Our own complaints can serve as signals
that let us know what we don't want so we can focus on what we do
want. And most importantly, we can use the no complaining rule to
develop a positive culture at work.
Does it work? You bet. In a commoditized market, Cooper's company is
outperforming the competition by leaps and bounds. Like Cooper, with
one simple rule, you can prevent the spread of toxic negative energy and
empower your team to improve, innovate, and grow. I've heard from
hundreds of companies, schools, and teams that have transformed their
culture and team dynamic with it. But it doesn't happen without positive
leadership. As a leader, it starts with you. If you are complaining, you're
not leading. If you are complaining, you are not showing your team the
way forward. Complaining causes you and your team to focus on

everything but being your best. It causes you to be stuck where you are
instead of moving forward to where you want to be. In dysfunctional
negative cultures, leaders focus on the problems. In positive, highperforming cultures, leaders focus on solving problems. Positive leaders
show the way forward. They help their team focus on solutions instead of
complaints. When a team focuses on solutions instead of complaints,
performance rises to a higher level.

Michael Phelps's Positive Leadership
Michael Phelps was recently interviewed by Bob Costas and he
described his approach to building a positive team before the 2016
Olympics in Rio.
Every now and then you hear a bunch of negative comments or
someone complaining, and, during training camp, at one of the
meetings, I said to the guys that we are getting ready to go to the
Olympics. This is what we have to do, and if there is a negative
comment, keep it to yourself. The more positivity we have as a team,
the better off we are going to be. As soon as I said that, we all
became closer and then we really started getting going.
When I heard Phelps say these words, I was thrilled because, in just a
few sentences, he defined the essence of positive leadership and shared
with the world a truth that I have witnessed countless times over the
years. A team with talent can be good, but they must come together to be
great. Positivity is the glue that enhances team connection and
performance, and it impacts office teams, school teams, church teams,
and hospital teams as much as it does Olympic teams. Many people
think that you have to choose between positivity and winning, but the
truth is you don't have to choose. Positivity leads to winning. That's why
feeding the positive and weeding out the negative is essential.
I've seen very positive teams with average talent accomplish more than
anyone thought possible. I've also seen negative teams with a lot of
talent accomplish far less than everyone thought was possible. Positive
teams work together more effectively. They stay positive, connected, and
committed through challenges. They maximize each other's talent. They
believe together and achieve more together. Positive, high-performing
teams don't happen by accident. They are built by positive leaders and

teams don't happen by accident. They are built by positive leaders and
team members who weed the negative and feed the positive. When you
subtract negativity and add positivity to your talent, the sky is the limit.
The great news is that you don't have to be an Olympic champion with 28
medals to begin the process. You can be just like you and me. You can
say, “Enough with the negativity. Let's get positive. Let's get going.”

Don't Be Negative about Negativity
I would be remiss if I didn't share one final thought about weeding
negativity from your team and organization. I must address a
misunderstanding that I hear about from time to time and it's one of my
motivations in writing this book. Some leaders read The Energy Bus and
make the mistake of confronting their employees by saying, “You are
either on my bus or you are off it.” They label anyone who disagrees with
them an energy vampire. Instead of inviting people onto the bus, they run
them over with it. One of the saddest kinds of emails I receive says
something like, “Hey Jon, our bosses gave us The Energy Bus to read,
but they are the ones who are energy vampires. I'm trying to be positive
but what should I do?” It saddens me to read these emails because it
was never my intention for leaders to be negative about negativity. You
have to confront it, but you must do so in a positive way. Even more
importantly, you must model it. As we will discuss in the next two
chapters, positive leadership is also about developing relationships and
being the kind of a leader people want to follow. You can't be an energy
vampire and be a great leader. You can't be negative and build a
positive, high-performing team. You may be dealing with a lot of
negativity but you can't lift others up if you lower yourself. You can't help
others be positive by being negative. You're the leader, and to be your
best and bring out the best in others, you must be a positive leader.
When you feed the positive and weed the negative, you create an
environment where you can do your best work as a leader. You can do
what the truly great leaders do, and that's build unified and connected
teams and great relationships.

CHAPTER 7
POSITIVE LEADERS CREATE UNITED AND
CONNECTED TEAMS
It's the leader's ability to unite and connect people that truly creates
great teams and organizations.
Positive leaders unite instead of divide. They are able to get everyone on
the bus and moving in the right direction. They are able to create unity,
which is the difference between a great team and an average team. The
more united and connected a team and organization is, the more they are
able to accomplish together. A vision and North Star are important to
point people in the right direction, but it's the leader's ability to unite and
connect people that truly creates great teams and organizations. When
Alan Mulally took over as the CEO of Ford, he learned that they were
regionalized and acted like they were a number of different companies
instead of one company. Mulally created a One Ford plan to unite
everyone in the company and come together as one team working on
one plan to achieve one goal. He created an entire plan and
management system designed to have everyone work together as one
united and connected team. He held meetings every Thursday at 7AM,
where every leader from every division in the company would come
together, review the business plan (he called it a BPR—Business Plan
Review meeting), and work together to achieve it. He fostered trust,
generated transparency and honesty, simplified the business model,
brought clarity to their mission and purpose, and, through what many
people say is one of the most inspiring and amazing displays of
leadership in history, he transformed Ford into one team that
accomplished what many of the naysayers and critics thought was
impossible. Mulally proved that over time the naysayers are proven
wrong and a positive leader who unites others and creates a connected
team that works together is proven right.

Connection Is the Difference

The more I have worked with teams and organizations over the years,
the more I realize that connection is the key to becoming a great
organization. Just as Alan Mulally created One Ford by connecting
everyone in the company, a leader must work to create a connected
team. It starts at the top. A team and organization that's not connected at
the top crumbles at the bottom. Therefore, first and foremost, it's
important for the leadership team to be connected. I've worked with far
too many sports teams and organizations where the leadership teams
are not connected. I can literally predict the success of a sports team
based on how connected the owner, general manager, and head coach
are. I can tell how well a business will weather their challenges and grow
by how unified and connected the leaders are. I recently spoke at a
meeting where two companies were merging together and leaders from
both companies were now becoming one management group. We talked
a lot about connecting and did some connection exercises, and you could
see and feel the energetic walls break down. Everyone who left the
meeting felt that they would be much stronger going forward. Instead of
two teams, they were now one team. I knew they were on their way to
success because unity and connection are the difference. I once sat in on
a morning meeting of the leaders at Mercy Hospital in St. Louis. They
were one of the most connected leadership teams I've ever witnessed. It
was so powerful you could feel the connection. I was blown away. It was
no surprise that their hospital was performing at a very high level.
As a leader, you not only want to be part of a connected leadership team
but you also want to make sure you are connecting with everyone in your
organization. A lack of connection between leaders and their team leads
to a lack of commitment, below-average teamwork, and sub-par
performance and results. You can be the smartest person in the room but
if you fail to connect with others you will fail as a leader. When you make
time to connect with your team and create unity by bringing people
together, performance will rise to create a united and connected
organization. It's also essential as a leader to enhance the connection
between the people on the team and in the organization. As a positive
leader, you must be a unifier and connector who fosters relationships
between others. One of the biggest complaints I receive from college and
pro coaches is that their teams aren't connected. They have a bunch of
young men or women who usually focus on themselves, their personal

goals, their social media followings, and their egos. They usually have
family and friends telling them they should be playing more, scoring
more, or getting more recognition. The message they receive from the
world is that it's all about the individual, not the team. It's about me, not
we. Unfortunately, this may sound like your office and organization as
well. There are a lot of silos, personal agendas, and office politics in the
business world. This is also very common in schools, where teachers will
say they just care about their classroom and couldn't care less about
what's happening in the rest of the building. The disease of me infects
everyone, not just college athletes. Narcissism and self-focus creates a
disconnect between personal goals and team goals, and it undermines
the team. People who put themselves and their projects before the team
don't build great organizations. People who focus more on their fiefdoms
instead of on the kingdom are the ones who blame others when the
castle falls. Through my work with coaches and teams, I have found that
when coaches and players focus on becoming a connected team, the me
dissolves into we. The individual silos come crumbling down, bonds are
strengthened, relationships are developed, and the team becomes much
more connected, committed, and stronger. As a leader, you can't allow
people to stay isolated. You can't allow the disease of me to infect your
organization. In my work with schools, I find that many teachers only care
about their own classrooms and not about the entire school because the
leader hasn't done a great job of connecting the staff and has failed to
create a unified school. It's important to create unity and wholeness. It
needs to be a priority and it doesn't happen without intentionality and
action.
While visiting an NBA team a few years ago, I watched their game the
night before I was speaking to the coaching staff. While meeting with the
coaching staff, they asked me what I saw. I told them I could tell there
was a disconnect between some of the players. They couldn't believe it.
They thought one of the coaches had told me what was happening
behind the scenes but I didn't need anyone to tell me. When you work
with enough teams and organizations you can tell who is connected and
who isn't. You know when you see it and you know when you don't.
When I don't see solid connections, I try to help nurture them. One of my
favorite exercises to help team members become more connected is to
have each person share a defining moment in their life. When you learn

someone's defining moment, you get to know them a whole lot better and
develop a stronger connection with them. My other favorite exercise is to
have each person on the team share their hero, hardship, and highlight.

Team Beats Talent When Talent Isn't a Team
One of the reasons why being united is so important is because the more
connected you are, the more committed you become. You won't have
commitment without connection. Team connection makes a difference.
Before the 2013–14 college basketball season, I received a call from Billy
Donovan, who at the time was the University of Florida basketball coach.
(Now he is the head coach of the Oklahoma City Thunder.) Billy shared
the challenges his team was facing and asked for my advice. I shared a
few of my ideas with him and he immediately zoomed in on the concept
of connection. He said, “That's it, Jon. We often get to the Elite Eight but
have trouble pushing through to the Final Four because we aren't as
connected as we need to be. If we are more connected, we will have a
better chance of winning the tight, big games.” Billy and I kept in touch
during the season and I was blown away by all he did to connect with his
players and foster relationships between them. I never saw a coach do
more to invest in a team than what Billy did that season. The walls came
crumbling down and, instead of a group of individuals, the Florida team
became a connected family. They pushed through the Elite Eight to the
Final Four and beat a very talented Kentucky team three times that
season. Despite the fact that not one person on their team was drafted
into the NBA, Florida was able to beat teams with more talent because
they were more connected. They are a great example that team beats
talent when talent isn't a team. You may not have the most talented
people on your team, but if you are a connected team, you will
outperform many talented teams who lack a close bond. When a leader
and team connect with each other, commitment, teamwork, chemistry,
and performance improve dramatically. Since that time I've worked with a
number of coaches to help them build connected teams and I've
witnessed the power of connection and unity. Erik Spoelstra, the coach of
the Miami Heat, told me he used to spend a majority of his time studying
film in the off season. Now he spends more time building connections
and team unity than he does watching film. I spoke to his team about the

importance of being connected and, over the course of the season, you
could see the way they grew to play for each other rather than
themselves. It doesn't happen by accident. Erik is an incredible leader
and he and his staff are very intentional in finding ways, such as a
mandatory Super Bowl viewing party, meaningful team conversations,
and intense player development, to consistently connect individually and
collectively. Even a coach that has won 1,000 games, Tara VanDerveer,
the women's basketball coach at Stanford, is always looking for ways
help her team become more connected. We've had great conversations
one on one and with her team about fostering connections, and I have
loved watching a great leader like her find new ways to connect with her
team and help them connect with each other.

Dabo Swinney's Safe Seat
It's not just Dabo Swinney's vision and belief that helped Clemson make
it to back-to-back National Championship games and win a title. While I
was sitting in Dabo's office in early August, he told me about a chair his
friend found and brought him from a remote fishing village. He said it was
one of those fishing villages where guys sit around in a circle on these
stools and talk about life, family, fishing, and so on. It gave Dabo an idea,
and he called it the Safe Seat. He placed the stool in the team meeting
room and after each practice a different teammate sat on the Safe Seat
while the team gathered around him in a circle. Dabo then asked the
teammate questions about his life, his heroes, his defining moment, and
his challenges. When Dabo was finished asking questions, the rest of the
team was free to ask questions. The stool was called the Safe Seat
because it was a safe place for each person to share his story and heart
with his team. It was a safe place to be vulnerable, knowing that
whatever was shared while sitting on the stool would not leave the room.
It was a safe spot in a safe room. As each teammate took their turn in the
Safe Seat, the players began to know each other a whole lot better. The
walls of ego, pride, and selfishness came crumbling down as vulnerability
and authenticity paved the way for meaningful relationships, trust, and
strong bonds that helped create a connected and committed team.
Becoming a connected and committed team helped make the vision and
belief come to fruition.

Collaborate and Facilitate
The old dictatorial style of leadership no longer works. Telling people to
do it “because I said so” doesn't engage, connect, and unite people. The
great leaders of today lead by collaborating and facilitating. Alan Mulally
didn't just talk about One Ford, he collaborated with his leaders and
everyone in the company to create it. He didn't dominate discussions and
conversations during their weekly leadership BPR meetings, but rather
guided the conversations and facilitated the process of discussing the
issues, challenges, and initiatives that needed to be addressed and
implemented and then empowered the other leaders in the room to
identify solutions and collaborate in solving them. Great leaders like
Mulally don't pretend to know all the answers. They collaborate with
others and facilitate the process of finding and implementing the
answers. Positive leaders don't succeed on their own. They succeed by
getting people to work together. This generates more connection,
ownership, and buy-in.
It's important to note that, as a leader, it's not always easy to facilitate
and collaborate. You may see where you want to go and become
frustrated at first that people don't see the vision and aren't buying in.
This could lead to you running ahead with or without your people, hoping
they will catch up. But if you don't take your team with you, you'll be
ahead of the pack all by yourself. At that point you are just a runner, not a
leader, because a leader runs and walks WITH their team.
When I recently visited Penn State to speak to all the athletes and
coaches, I sat down with the athletic director, Sandy Barbour, and
learned that, to her, the call that “We are Penn State” is not just a slogan,
but also words she lives by as a leader. The word we is very important to
her and it's why she's the perfect leader to guide her athletic program
through all the challenges of the past and the changing landscape of
college sports. Various coaches and leaders I met on campus told me
privately that “Sandy doesn't talk at us, she walks with us. She works with
us. She is there for us. She collaborates with us.” Like Alan Mulally,
Barbour has a great idea where she wants to go, but she knows that a
great team will achieve much more by working together than one person
can by working alone.

Don't Let Your Reptile Eat Your Positive Dog
If unity and connection are so essential, then I must address why so
many teams and organizations aren't more united and why more leaders
don't create unity and connection. I'm convinced that besides selfishness,
the enemies are busyness and stress. The research shows when we are
busy and stressed, we activate the reptilian part of our brain, which is
associated with fear and survival.10 If you know anything about a reptile,
you know that they will never love you. Reptiles are incapable of love
because they are all about survival. They're not interested in uniting and
connecting with you unless they can eat you. When we are busy and
stressed, we activate our reptile brains and are simply about survival. We
are not thinking about uniting our teams and connecting with others. We
are only thinking of our own survival and how we can get through the
day. As a result, we focus on what is urgent rather than what matters. We
focus on our to-do list and how to survive rather than on our people and
ways to thrive. We don't make the time to unite and connect. There's
actually a scientific term for this: cortical inhibition. That is when the
amygdala (reptile brain) highjacks the neocortex, the part of the brain
where you rationalize, make decisions, pray, practice gratitude, and love.
I call the neocortex the positive dog part of the brain because of the
loving nature of dogs. When you are busy and stressed, your reptile, in
essence, eats your positive dog. This is what happened to you anytime
you said something you wished you hadn't said. Your reptile ate your
positive dog and just blurted out something mean that you would never
say if you were thinking clearly. It's what happens to coaches when the
TV camera is on them and they are going crazy, yelling at a referee. It's
what happens during road-rage incidents. And it's what happens when
leaders fail to make time to connect with and unite their teams. The good
news is that the research shows we have a quarter-second to override
the reptile with our positive dog. We don't have to let the reptile win. We
can understand that the enemies are busyness and stress, and recognize
when our reptile is coming alive like Bruce Banner does when the Hulk
begins to emerge. We can take a deep breath when we realize we are
getting stressed and find something to be thankful for in that moment.
The research shows you can't be stressed and thankful at the same time.
And in each of these moments we can remember that our job as leaders

is to unite and connect, and not let the enemies conquer and divide. We
can slow down and be more intentional in focusing on the relationships
that truly build unity, connection, and great teams. When you know unity
is the key and busyness and stress are the enemies, you will slow down
and make the time to develop and build great relationships. A united
organization happens when you have great relationships. A strong and
united culture is created by strong relationships and strong teams. It
doesn't happen right away. It requires a lot of patience and a tremendous
amount of effort to build unity through great relationships and teamwork.
It is created through a lot of love, communication, encouragement,
interpersonal connection, commitment, serving, and caring, and it starts
with a leader who is someone people want to follow. So now let's talk
about how to create unity by building great relationships and teams.

CHAPTER 8
POSITIVE LEADERS BUILD GREAT
RELATIONSHIPS AND TEAMS
Leadership comes down to taking care of the people in your
organization and making them the best they can be, not giving up on
them and never failing to be there for them.
Pete Carroll
The first step in uniting people and being a leader is not saying, “Follow
me.” It's being someone your team wants to follow. You can have the
greatest vision and mission statement in the world and be optimistic and
positive, but if you are not someone people want to follow, they are not
getting on your bus. People follow the leader first and their vision second.
What you say is important, but who you are is even more important.
Leading is more than sharing a vision and being optimistic. It's more than
talking and thinking. It's also about investing in relationships, bringing out
the best in others, coaching, encouraging, serving, caring, and being
someone that your team can trust. The two questions that the people you
lead are asking are, “Can I trust you?” and “Do you care about me?” To
be someone who people want to follow, you have to be someone they
can trust—someone who cares about the people you lead. To unite
others, you have to be someone people want to rally around. To connect
with others, you have to be someone who creates connections.

Love Does
Leadership begins with love. Bob Goff, the author of Love Does, says
that love is not a noun. It's a verb. It's about leading with and sharing
love. It's about putting love into action. Bob wrote a bestselling book and
he has lived a life worth writing about. Goff is the founder of Love Does, a
nonprofit that fights the injustices committed against children. Goff has
spent years working to rescue underage girls from the bondage of sexual
slavery. He has worked against forced prostitution in India by arresting
over 80 criminals and placing trafficked children in temporary and

permanent housing. He has frequently traveled to Uganda, where he has
risked his life bringing over 200 trials to court to relieve children of
imprisonment. Goff and Love Does also built a school, Restore
Leadership Academy, that serves over 250 children in the war-torn area
of northern Uganda. When people ask me to describe Goff, I say he's a
combination of Indiana Jones and Jesus. He travels around the world
taking on witch doctors, criminals, and injustice while being one of the
most loving, positive leaders I've ever met. When Goff is not spending
time with his wife, whom he calls “Sweet Maria,” he's traveling to
Uganda, saving children, speaking to audiences, and answering calls on
his cell phone from complete strangers because he put his cell phone
number in the back of his book. Yes, he actually put his cell phone
number in the book. I know because I called it to see if he would answer.
He did. Why did he put his number in the book? It's the same reason why
he does everything: because that's what love does. Goff said most
people usually call and say, “Bob, is that really you?” And when he says
yes, they say they loved his book and thanks for answering and then
hang up. He said people just want to know that he's for real. From seeing
Goff in action it's clear that since they know his love is real, they follow
with passion and loyalty. It's the same with you as a leader. Your people
want to know if you are for real. Show them you are by the way you love
them.

Love Is the Greatest Leadership Principle on the
Planet
Goff and many of the positive leaders I have met demonstrate that love is
the greatest leadership principle on the planet. I was recently speaking to
a school district and met a principal whom everyone loves and admires.
She turned around her school from being an at-risk school to a model
school in her district. I asked her the secret. She said, “I love my staff and
students. Everything I do is to make them better.” I was at a sales
conference and met a gentleman who was the top salesperson in the
company. I asked him his secret. He said, “I love my clients and they
know it.” I was visiting a professional sports team that the coach had
transformed from a perennial loser into a perennial winner. I asked some
of the players what the secret was. They said it was coach: “He loves the

game. He loves us. We are like a family.” Regardless of title or
profession, to be human is to love and want to be loved. We are who we
are because someone loved us and our team will be impacted by our
love. Love is what separates good and great. Good teachers know their
lesson plans. Great teachers know and love their students. Good
coaches know X's and O's. Great coaches know and love their players.
Good salespeople know how to sell. Great salespeople love their clients.
Good leaders know their vision and purpose. Great leaders also know
and love their people. If you want to build a great team, business, family,
school, or organization, love the people you lead and work with.

Rules without Relationship Lead to Rebellion
Andy Stanley once said, “Rules without relationship lead to rebellion.” Far
too many leaders share rules with the people they lead but they don't
have a relationship with them. So what happens? The people they lead
disengage from the mission and vision of the organization. I've had many
leaders tell me that when they focus less on rules and invest more in their
relationships they experience a dramatic increase in performance,
morale, and engagement. If you are in education, research shows that
when principals have a relationship with their teachers, engagement
rises; when students have a relationship with their teachers, test scores
go up.11 In sports, players will play harder for their coaches when they
know the coaches love them. In business, if a client knows their
representative, agent, or salespeople care about them, they will never
leave and will refer everyone they know to them. Success comes down to
people and relationships and building something together. When you love
someone, you take the time to invest in a relationship with them to help
them improve and grow. People can tell when you have an agenda, so
don't have one. Just build great relationships and build something great
together.

Communication Builds Trust
If you love someone, you take the time to invest in a relationship with
them. To invest in a relationship with them, you must communicate with
them. Relationships are the foundation upon which great teams and

organizations are built, and communication serves as the initial
foundation in building a great relationship. Unfortunately, most
relationships and teams break down because of poor communication. In
a world where we have more ways to communicate, we are
communicating less meaningfully and our relationships, teamwork, and
overall engagement and performance are suffering. Communication
builds trust. Trust generates commitment. Commitment fosters teamwork,
and teamwork delivers great results. If you don't have communication,
you don't have the commitment and trust you need to build a great team
and create the future together.
I was having dinner with Doc Rivers, the head coach of the Los Angeles
Clippers, and I asked Doc what was the most important thing he does as
a coach. He said, “I communicate to my team. Not just collectively as a
team but individually. I have to know where each person is in order to
lead them where I need them to be. Since I communicate often with
them, I know who is struggling with a personal issue. I know who needs
encouragement. I know who needs to be challenged.” I then asked Doc
what he would like to improve upon as a coach. He said, “I would like to
improve my communication.” I was blown away. Here was a coach who
was considered by many as the best communicator in sports and he
wanted to get even better. It demonstrates how important communication
is and how much every leader needs to focus on it. Many leaders
communicate collectively and communicate with everyone at once, but
I'm convinced we need to learn from Doc and spend more time, energy,
and effort communicating one on one. Please know that I realize it's not
easy to consistently have one-on-one communication with everyone in
the organization. I realize you can't meet with everyone all the time,
especially if you lead a large organization. The key is to meet with your
leadership team and the people you lead directly, and then make sure
they are communicating well with the people they lead. If everyone does
this throughout the organization, relationships, teamwork, and
performance will improve. What does this look like? A principal of a
school would schedule two or three 10-minute meetings each day with
teachers and members of their staff. A hospital administrator could do the
same with their doctors and nurses, or the manager of a business could
have a meeting with a few of her direct reports each week. Coach Russ
Rose, the six-time National Champion women's volleyball coach at Penn

State, created a communication tool he calls the 1-Minute Drill, where he
calls a player into his office at various times during the season for a short
one-on-one meeting. He tells them what they are doing well, what they
need to work on, and here is where their focus should be during the next
training cycle. He then asks if they have any questions. It's a quick
effective way to provide direct and honest feedback, clarify expectations,
alleviate uncertainty, and improve individual and team performance.

Where There Is a Void in Communication,
Negativity Fills It
I have found that where there is a void in communication, negativity will
fill it. Without great communication, negativity fills the void and it breeds
and grows, resulting in negative contagious energy that quickly spreads.
This is why communication is also essential. It not only develops great
relationships and trust, but it also prevents the spread of rumors and
negative energy that can sabotage a team and organization. A few years
ago, the Los Angeles Clippers faced a crisis when the owner at the time,
Donald Sterling, made racist remarks. The media and the world were in a
frenzy, but Doc communicated with his team like he always had. Doc built
such a strong foundation that they were able to weather the storm.
Weaker cultures and teams without great communication would have
crumbled, but Doc and his team stayed strong together. You can't wait
for a crisis to hit to start communicating with your team. You must
communicate before a crisis so your foundation will be strong enough to
overcome it. Make sure you make communication your number-one
priority. It's often the last thing you want to do but it's the most important
thing you must do. Communicate more individually and collectively.
What does filling the void look like? At 8:31 AM Monday morning, all
employee weekly meetings are held and challenges, weekly goals, and
hot topics are discussed. Hold daily teleconferences with a sales team to
communicate obstacles, wins, and learning opportunities. Establish a
daily or weekly Skype session with a leader and their virtual team that's
spread out around the globe. Set a daily call at noon where a manager
shares an inspirational message with everyone in his company (like One
Minute Manager author Ken Blanchard does at his company). At home,

conduct a weekly family meeting, like the one my family holds on
Sundays. We talk about our family mission statement, our challenges
from the past week, upcoming challenges, and anything that's on our
hearts and minds. All of these ways of filling the void look like a leader
communicating frequently with his team and providing honest and
transparent updates about the big changes coming their way.

Leading by Walking Around
A great way to fill voids in communication is to get out of your office and
interact with the people that you lead. Whether this means visiting people
in the office; eating in the cafeteria as Doug Conant, the CEO of The
Campbell Soup Company, did frequently; or traveling to different cities
and countries, nothing beats face-to-face communication. When you
interact with your team and organization, you break down the barriers of
us versus them and build we. You develop strong relationships, a strong
team, and a strong organization.
In You Win in the Locker Room First, Coach Mike Smith described how
each day he made a couple of trips to the training room to visit with
players who were getting treatment. He always wanted them to know that
he was concerned and interested in how they were doing, regardless of
their practice status. Some of the best conversations he ever had with
players took place in the training room. He would also visit the weight
room and talk to players and assistant coaches who were getting a
workout. Mike said he also made it a point to eat with his players
because he felt this environment allowed for more natural conversations
to take place and that he learned a lot and developed great relationships
with his players just by talking to them during meals. And, of course, he
spent a lot of time in the locker room and would often walk in and just
look around to see who was talking to who, what the energy was like, and
what the overall mood of the team was. Mike called his approach “taking
the temperature of the building.” He didn't read the thermostat but rather
would take the pulse of the team and the energy in the building. Mike
said that oftentimes, leaders will only concern themselves with the
temperature of the organization when things are not going well. This can
be a big miscalculation. It is just as important to know what the vibes are

when things are going well. In any organization the pulse can be different
every day based on what's happening. The dynamics of an organization,
whether in sports or business, are always changing and, as the leader,
you have to be prepared to manage the ebbs and flows that occur by
taking the temperature each day. Having an accurate assessment of the
mood of the building and organization at all times will allow you to make
the best decisions for your team or organization. Mike said he had
“thermostats” around the building. Members of the training staff,
equipment managers, communications staff, and player-development
team members were invaluable. When walking around, he would ask
these people, “What's the temperature today?” They shared priceless
information about players and Mike became aware of many different
situations, both positive and negative, by having these conversations.
Mike said that by asking what the temperature was, “I not only learned
more about the team and who was in a bad mood, but I helped our
organization operate at the highest level and deal with potentially
negative issues before they impacted our culture and performance.” As a
leader you can't just speak to other leaders who have the same vantage
point as you. You have to engage people who are closest to the potential
challenges facing your organization. You have to ask questions, listen,
and learn, and then decide how to use the readings to make decisions
going forward.

Listening Is Communicating
People often think of communication as talking, but it's also about
listening. The best communicator is not always the most eloquent
speaker, but rather the person who has the ability to listen, process the
information, and use it to make decisions that are in the best interest of
the team and organization. The best listeners truly hear what a person is
saying and trying to convey. Having worked with Mike Smith for seven
years while he was the coach of the Falcons, I noticed his greatest
strength as a leader was the way he listened to his team. While visiting
the facility, I always saw one of Mike's players talking to him and Mike
listening intently. They knew he cared about them and, as a result, they
always gave their all for him.
Research shows that when people feel like they are seen and heard

Research shows that when people feel like they are seen and heard
there is a moistening in the eyes, and yet in 90 percent of our
conversations there is no moistening in the eyes. As a positive leader, it's
important to be a positive communicator and make others feel important
by listening to them and truly hearing what they have to say.

Enhance Your Positive Communication
Positive leaders are also positive communicators. They communicate in
such a way that they make people around them better. One of my
favorite phrases, for example, is “shout praise, whisper criticism.” It
comes from the original Olympic Dream Team and Detroit Pistons
coaches Chuck Daly and Brendan Suhr. They won NBA Championships
and an Olympic gold medal, thanks to a lot of talent and great
communication. They gained the trust of their players and built winning
teams by praising in public and constructively criticizing in private.
Shouting praise means you recognize someone in front of their peers,
and whispering criticism means you coach them to get better. Both build
better people and teams.
Smiling is also a big part of positive communication. When you share a
real smile, it not only produces more serotonin in your brain but in the
brain of the recipient of your smile. Just by smiling at someone, you are
giving them a dose of serotonin, an antidepressant. Never underestimate
the power of a smile. As a positive communicator, you have the power to
make someone feel better just by smiling. No matter what your job is,
when you smile at someone, remember you are acting as a pharmacist
giving them an antidepressant.
Positive communicators also spread positive gossip. Instead of sharing
negative gossip, be the kind of communicator who spreads positive news
about people. My college lacrosse teammate Mike Connelly is famous for
this. Whenever you talk to him he is always praising our mutual friends.
“Did you hear how awesome so and so is doing? Their kids are doing
great!” He never says a negative word about anyone. He always spreads
the positive news and the best part is that you know when you are not
around he is likely sharing something positive, not negative, about you.
It's no surprise he's been a huge success in business.
Positive leaders and communicators also listen to and welcome ideas
and suggestions on how they can improve. They don't fear criticism.

and suggestions on how they can improve. They don't fear criticism.
They welcome it, knowing it makes them better. They send a clear signal
to their team, customers, coaches, and everyone around them that they
are always willing to learn, improve, and grow. Positive communicators
say “I'm open. Make me better. Let's get better together.” I did this to my
wife one time when she wanted to give me parenting advice. Instead of
being defensive, I listened. She was surprised and, after a few short
hours of telling me how I can improve, I put some of her ideas into
practice and made myself and my children better.
I also believe positive leaders and communicators rely on nonverbal
communication. They encourage through nods, facial expressions highfives, handshakes, pats on the back, fist bumps, and even hugs when
appropriate. Positive communication isn't just verbal. It's also physical.
Several studies have demonstrated the benefits of physical contact
between doctors and patients, teachers and students, and professional
athletes. For example, in one study the best NBA teams were also the
touchiest (high-fives, pats on the back, hugs). In a world where physical
touch has become taboo because of misuse and abuse, we must
remember that it is a way we humans communicate naturally and is very
powerful and beneficial when done appropriately with good intention.12
Personally, I'm a fist bumper and a hugger. When I meet people at
speaking engagements I give them a choice: bump or hug. Whichever
they are more comfortable with is great with me.

Be an Encourager
Truett Cathy, the founder of Chick-Fil-A, asked rhetorically, “How do you
know if a man or woman needs encouragement?” His response: “If they
are breathing.” We all need encouragement and positive communicators
encourage and inspire others to do more and become more than they
ever thought possible. Positive leaders are great encouragers and it's
something the world needs more of. With so many people telling us we
can't succeed, we need to hear people telling us we can. I remember my
high school English teacher telling me not to apply to Cornell University
because they wouldn't accept me and, even if they did, I wouldn't be able
to do the work. (It's funny that I'm a writer now.) I almost didn't apply, but
a few days later I saw Ivan Goldfarb, a former teacher, in the hallway and

asked him about Cornell. He said, “You apply. If you get in, then you go.
You can do it.” His words made all the difference. I applied, was
accepted, and majored in lacrosse. Too often we think it's our role to
inject a dose of “reality” into someone's life. We think it's our job to
protect people from the pain of failure and defeat. We think that dreams
were meant for others. I say there are enough pessimists and realists in
the world. The world doesn't need more negativity and impossible
thinkers. The world needs more optimists, encouragers, and inspirers.
The world needs more people to speak into the hearts of others and say,
“I believe in you. Follow your passion and live your purpose. If you have
the desire then you also have the power to make it happen. Keep
working hard. You're improving and getting better. Keep it up. The
economy is tough but you can still grow your business. The job market is
not great, but I believe you'll find the right job for you. We've hit a lot of
obstacles, but we'll get the project finished. Even if you fail, it will lead to
something even better. You're learning and growing.” We all love working
for and with people who bring out the best in us. We love being around
people who uplift us and make us feel great. And while we'll always
remember the negative people who told us we couldn't accomplish
something, we will always cherish and hold a special place in our heart
for those who encouraged us. I want to encourage you to be an
encourager. Leadership, as I wrote earlier, is a transfer of belief. Today,
decide to be that person who instills a positive belief in someone who
needs to hear your encouraging words. Uplift someone who is feeling
down. Fuel your team with your positive energy. Rally others to focus on
what is possible rather than what seems impossible. Share
encouragement. It will help build your relationships. It matters and we all
need it.

Believe in Others More than They Believe in
Themselves
I'll never forget the time I tried to quit lacrosse during my freshman year
in high school but my coach, Tony Caiazza, wouldn't let me. He told me
that I was going to play in college one day. He even said I would play in
the Ivy League. I didn't even know what the Ivy League was at the time.
He had a vision for me that I couldn't even fathom. He believed in me

more than I believed in myself. I ended up going to Cornell University to
play for Coach Richie Moran, who also believed in me, and the
experience changed my life forever. The difference between success and
failure is belief, and so often this belief is instilled in us by someone else.
Coach Caiazza was that person for me and it changed my life. You can
be that person for the people you lead if you believe in them and see
their potential rather than their limitations. It's amazing what people will
accomplish when they know you believe in them!

Help Your Team Become Unstoppable
Since I played lacrosse in college I encouraged my daughter to play as
well. But in elementary school, it didn't look like she had a future in
lacrosse. While the rest of the kids were running up and down the field
she would stand still, pick grass, and look up at the sky. It was honestly
very frustrating to watch. In middle school she started to get into the
action a little more and I saw signs of life. We would often throw the ball
around together and work on her stick skills. I saw improvement in
practice, but when she would play in the games she was very tentative. I
had to admit I wasn't a very positive leader at the time, and by pushing
my expectations and frustrations on her, I almost caused her to quit
playing. I was a classic transactional parent, where my identity was tied
to her success. I read Joe Ehrmann's book Inside Out Coaching, which is
about being transformational instead of transactional, and it changed me
as a parent. I still played and practiced with my daughter to help her
improve, but this time I did so with encouragement instead of frustration.
In ninth grade she made the high school varsity team and even started a
few games, but was benched because she missed a few passes in key
games. I continued to encourage her. We would practice her dodges in
the backyard often and she really improved, but she was still tentative
and never tried to dodge and score in the games. I started to tell her she
was unstoppable all the time. I would say “You are unstoppable, Jade.
They can't stop you. Take it to the goal. You are unstoppable.” This was
funny because at the time she was very stoppable. In the 10th grade she
became a starter once again but was benched after not playing well in
one or two games. I knew she had it in her to be great but she wasn't
showing it. The old me would have yelled at her but the new me just

encouraged her and kept telling her she was unstoppable. “Just take it to
the cage and shoot, Jade. They can't stop you. You are unstoppable.” I
said it often and she would just smile. I kept hoping and praying she
would realize her potential, unsure if it would ever happen. During her
junior year I kept practicing with her and encouraging her and telling her
she was unstoppable. And then finally she became unstoppable. She
scored 80 goals that season, 8 in the district finals and 7 in the state
semifinals, to help her team make it to the state finals. She was named
an Academic All American and received offers to play lacrosse in college.
It was so enjoyable to watch her play and rewarding to know that we did
it the right way. I had to experience the power of positive leadership
firsthand before I could write a book on it. From almost ruining my
daughter, to becoming a positive leader who encouraged and believed in
her, I know the difference it makes.

Connect One on One
While communication and encouragement builds trust and develops the
relationship, connecting is where trust is earned, the bond is created, the
relationship is strengthened, commitment is generated, and great
coaching and leadership happens. Positive leaders do more than just
communicate, they connect heart to heart. I spoke in the previous
chapter about how leaders create a united and connected organization
and team, but organization and team connection is the result of individual
connection. The greatest leaders I've been around connect with those
they lead. I've watched the way Cori Close, the basketball coach at
UCLA; Sherri Coale, the basketball coach at Oklahoma University; and
Deanna Gumpf, the Notre Dame softball coach lead and interact with
their teams. I've seen how they communicate, connect, and treat their
players like family. I know how much time and effort they make to
connect with each player and it's why they have built successful
programs over time. Without connection you'll never have commitment,
but when you connect, you generate the commitment that leads to
greater performance and success. I'm convinced you can't truly coach
someone to grow unless you know and have a relationship with them.
Connection and relationships are what drive real growth.

I witnessed a great example of a coach connecting with his player while
visiting the Los Angeles Dodgers the day before they clinched a spot in
the postseason in 2016. I had spoken to the coaches and team during
spring training about how to build a winning team and the importance of
being a connected team. Now here I was, six months later, sitting and
talking with the manager, Dave Roberts, in his office, when one of his
players walked in to say hello. Dave got up from his chair and gave the
player a big bear hug for about five seconds. It was the kind of hug that a
dad would give his son after returning home from a long trip. They talked
for a little bit about life and practice before the player said I'll see you
later and left. I told Dave how great it was that he would give his player a
hug like that. He said, “I do it each day and he often stops by to talk
about life and challenges and whatever is on his mind.” A few weeks
later, while watching the Dodgers play the Nationals in the postseason I
watched in amazement as this player hit home runs in Games 4 and 5 to
help the Dodgers advance. It was as if I had a front-row seat to see the
impact of what happens when a coach makes the time to pour love and
support into one of his players. This player who had struggled the year
before was now one of the heroes because his leader took the time to
connect and care about him. Dave's commitment to connect wasn't
isolated to just this one player. As Dave showed me around the facility, I
watched as he had meaningful and frequent touch points and
connections with every player and coach we encountered. It was fun and
special to watch positive leadership in action.

Be Committed
Communication, encouragement, belief, listening, and connecting are
essential to build great relationships and great teams, but without
commitment nothing great will ever be built or accomplished. Every
leader wants committed people on their team. We all want a committed
team. But if you want commitment, you must be committed. If you want
commitment from your team, you must show your commitment to your
team. You can't just talk about your commitment. They must feel your
commitment. When the people you lead see and feel your commitment,
they will be more committed to you and each other. When leaders
complain to me that their teams aren't committed, I always tell them to

show their team what commitment looks like: “Go above and beyond. It
starts with you.”
“What does it look like?” they ask.
“It looks like putting the needs of others before your own.”

Serve to Be Great
A team feels a leader's commitment when the leader takes the time to
serve them. Jesus washed feet; Martin Luther King marched, went to jail,
and fought for equality; Mother Teresa fed the poor and healed the sick.
Over the years, I have met many leaders who served their teams in
simple, powerful ways. Many leaders think that, as they gain power and
responsibility, their teams should serve them more, but positive leaders
know that their job is to serve their teams. When you serve the team, you
help them grow and they help you grow. You can't serve yourself and
your team at the same time. You have to decide whether you are going to
serve me or we. You must decide if you are going to be a self-serving
“leader” or a true leader who serves others.
It's hard to be a positive servant-leader in today's world. Leaders are
under more pressure than ever to perform. If you are a business leader,
you must answer to the stock market, the board, and shareholders. If you
are a coach, you must answer to your owner, general manager, and fan
base. If you are a school leader you have to answer to your school board,
superintendents, and parents of students. With expectations come
pressure and stress that drive a leader to survive, which leads to selfpreservation rather than serving the team. When leaders become
focused on the fruit instead of the root, when they worry about the
outcome instead of the process of developing team members, they may
survive in the short run, but they will not thrive in the long run. Selfserving leaders don't leave legacies that change the world for the better.
They may make money and achieve some fame in the short run, but true
greatness is achieved when a leader brings out the greatness in others.
Great leaders are great servants. A great leader sacrifices and serves in
order to help team members become great. At the end of the day, it all
comes down to this: You don't have to be great to serve, but you have to
serve to be great. The big questions you must ask yourself each day are:

What am I doing to serve my team and the people I lead? How can I
serve them to help them be the best versions of themselves? How can I
demonstrate my commitment to them? These were questions I had to
ask myself and lead to lessons I needed to learn in order to be a better
leader.

Doing the Laundry
A few years ago my son came to my office while I was writing a new book
and asked me to play ping-pong. I said I was too busy. He came back
again and again. I finally said, “I can't. I'm writing a book about engaged
relationships.” Here I was writing a book about engaged relationships and
I was too busy to make time for the most important relationships of all!
Each year, I choose a word for the year and I knew that year my word
was going to be “serve.” I had been traveling a lot to speak to a number
of companies, schools, and sports teams, and my wife and teenage
children were struggling at home. I realized I needed to be more
committed to my team and start serving at home. So I turned down a
number of speaking engagements to make more time with my family. It
turned out to be the hardest year of my life. My daughter was not doing
great in school. My wife and son were butting heads. My wife was
stressed and having trouble managing it all. It was very frustrating
because I wanted my kids to be self-starters like I was as a kid. I wanted
my wife to be able to handle it all. Why did they need my help? Why
couldn't I just focus on making a difference in the world? Why couldn't I
have a different team? Yes, I admit it. I wanted a different team. Have
you ever wanted a different team? If you are a leader, coach, or parent I
know the answer is yes. Despite my frustration, I made the time to help
my team get better. I drove my daughter to school each day and
encouraged her. When she came home, I grilled her on her homework
assignments and test topics to make sure she was preparing and
studying. I put the kids to bed and prayed with them. I did the laundry
often. I got very involved in their everyday challenges. In short, I became
committed. At the end of the year, my wife asked me what my word
would be for the coming year. She asked if it was going to be “selfish,”
because she had never seen me do so much for my family. I told her no

way. “Serve” was now a part of me and my commitment. Making the time
to serve my family was how I showed I was truly committed to them. I
realized that I didn't need a different team. I needed to become a better
leader. Everything in my being wanted to focus on me, but I was at my
best when I focused on we. I also realized a great truth for leaders: We
have the team we have for a reason. The challenges we have with our
team are meant to make us better leaders. In the process of committing
to my family and learning to serve, I became a better leader. Ironically,
that's when my books and career took off.
When you are committed, your team notices. My son hurt his back
playing tennis and my wife took him to the chiropractor, who asked how I
was doing. My wife told him I was speaking at the World Leaders
Conference with a bunch of famous people. The chiropractor said, “Well,
Jon is kind of famous.” My son replied, “Not in our house. He does the
laundry.” When my wife told me this story I lit up. My son noticed my
commitment at home and that meant everything. At the end of the day, I
don't want to be a household name. I want to be a big name in my
household. My daughter is also doing great at school, my wife is much
happier, and I'm helping my son become the best version of himself. I
believe all success starts with making the team (home team, work team,
sports team) around you better.

It's Not About You
I first met Carl Liebert when he was the CEO of 24 Hour Fitness and
invited me to speak to the leaders of his company. Liebert was a
graduate of the Naval Academy and played on the Navy basketball team
with David Robinson. After a long and successful career with Home
Depot, Liebert brought his servant leadership approach to 24 Hour
Fitness. Before he became CEO, the executives of 24 Hour Fitness had
personal trainers visit their homes to train them in private, but Liebert
made it mandatory for the executives to train at the centers so they could
spend more time interacting with staff members and identify better ways
to serve their team and customers. He also required executives to work
for a week in one of their locations each year. Some executives chose to
work in membership sales while others worked as physical trainers or in

membership services. The experience helped the 24 Hour Fitness
leaders to not only better serve their team but also to understand the
needs of their members. It demonstrated their commitment to everyone,
and it made all the difference. After successfully transforming 24 Hour
Fitness, Liebert became the COO of USAA Insurance, where he
continues to demonstrate his servant leadership and commitment. I have
spent time at USAA and have personally witnessed the way he leads his
team with authenticity, humility, and commitment. He asks for input and
invites feedback. He shares his one word with everyone in the company
and invites everyone to share their words with him. He looks for ways to
develop the strengths of each team member and coaches them to be the
best versions of themselves. Most of all, he leads with humility, knowing
it's not about him—it's about his team. He doesn't like when I write about
him because he doesn't seek recognition, but I had to tell you about him
because his example is so powerful. Remember, it's not about you. It's
about committing yourself to others.

Commit to Coach
One of the reasons why I write a lot about coaches is because I spend a
lot of time with them, and one of the reasons why I spend time with them
is because I love the way great coaches commit to their teams. Everyone
talks about the brilliant minds of coaches like San Antonio Spurs head
coach Greg Popovich or New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick,
but if you look closer and spend time in their locker rooms, you would find
that their real secret is their commitment to coaching their players to be
their best. They give everything they have to help their players become
all they can be. They invest in them as people and performers, helping
them improve in all facets of their life. The media wouldn't describe them
as positive leaders, but their players know they are. Leaders beyond
sports need to learn to coach as well. I often tell leaders that you can't
coach everyone in the organization but you can coach your leadership
team to be better leaders and encourage them to coach their direct
reports and so on throughout the organization. If every leader committed
to coaching people, then performance, productivity, and profits would
soar! Years ago the Army would send its best men to the elite 75th
Ranger Regiment, but only about 30 percent would make it through.

Army leadership decided to invest more to prepare candidates for the
challenging training. The following year, 80 percent became Rangers.
The difference was coaching and an investment in people, process, and
preparation. When you selflessly commit to coaching, those you lead will
also create a culture of coaching in your organization, and everyone
benefits.

Commitment Requires Sacrifice
To build a great team and organization and to change the world, people
have to know and feel that you would run into a burning building to save
them. They have to know that you are willing to sacrifice yourself for their
gain. Positive leaders don't just share a positive vision and take the easy
road to get there. They often ignore the easy path and take the more
difficult road filled with service and sacrifice. When I think of the positive
leaders who changed the world, they were all committed to people. They
were committed to others and a cause greater than themselves. Long
before Rosa Parks decided not to give up her seat on a bus to a white
man in 1955, she had been an activist. Since 1943, she had been a
member of her local NAACP chapter, and she had marched on behalf of
injustices in our country. She would go on to say about her decision to
not give up her seat, “The only tired I was, was tired of giving in,” and her
simple act and commitment to others and a cause she believed in,
kickstarted the civil rights movement.
Mother Teresa committed her life to serving the poorest of the poor and
built her start-up missionary community of 13 members in Calcutta into a
global force for good of over 4,000 nuns running orphanages, serving the
poor, and healing the sick. A winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, she
inspired countless people to serve and she showed the world what
commitment looks like.
On the surface it looks like Oprah built herself a fortune by focusing on
her needs and taking the easy path, but this couldn't be further from the
truth. Yes, she built a media empire, but it was her perseverance, grit,
and commitment to helping people grow that made her empire possible.
Maya Angelou said, “A leader sees greatness in other people. He nor she
can't be much of a leader if all she sees is herself.” Positive leaders see
others and commit to bringing out the greatness of others.

others and commit to bringing out the greatness of others.

When You Help Others Improve, You Improve
The great thing about commitment is that when you commit your life to
helping others grow, you grow. Swen Nater was an All American at
Cypress Community College when John Wooden recruited him to play at
UCLA. As the story goes, Wooden told him that he wasn't going to play in
a lot of games because they already had the best center in the world in
Bill Walton, but Nater would have the opportunity to play against Walton
every day in practice. Wooden wanted the six-foot-eleven Nater to
challenge and push Walton to improve. Nater accepted his role during his
time at UCLA and every day in practice he focused on one task: making
Walton better. While he was helping Walton improve, something
interesting happened. Nater also improved. He was the only player in
ABA and NBA history to be drafted in the first round never having started
a collegiate game. Nater was named the ABA Rookie of the Year and
went on to have a 12-year career in the ABA and NBA. He is a great
example of how, when you help your team get better, you get better.
When you focus on helping others improve, you improve. When you lose
your ego in the service of others, you find the greatness within you. Great
leaders serve the people they lead. Nater's commitment to his team
helped him become a successful professional basketball player, and he's
now an executive with Costco, where he's making everyone around him
better. There are countless ways to help others improve. I can't tell you
what you should do, but I can tell you that when you commit to being a
positive leader dedicated to others, you will be well on your way to
transforming your team and the world.

Elite of the Elite
I met a leader of Special Forces for the United States, and he told me
how Navy Seals have to try out to be members of the elite group Seal
Team Six. While Navy Seals are considered to be elite members of
Special Forces, they have to try out to be members of the elite Seal
Team Six unit. He said that, while prospects are trying out, the current
team is looking for certain characteristics. If during the tryout a prospect
doesn't fit their criteria, Seal Team Six says, “Thank you very much, but

doesn't fit their criteria, Seal Team Six says, “Thank you very much, but
you're not the right fit.”
“What's the right fit?” I asked. He said what we are looking for is not just
someone who performs at the highest level but, while performing at the
highest level also looks out for his team members, making them better in
the process. It occurred to me that if you want to be elite you can be a
high performer, but if you want be the elite of the elite you have to be a
transformational positive leader and a high performer who makes others
better in the process.

Positive Leaders Care
It all comes down to caring. If you don't love, you don't care, and if you
don't care, you won't make the time to unite, communicate, encourage,
connect, commit, serve, or sacrifice. Positive leaders care about the
people they lead. They care about their team and organization. They care
about changing the world because they know the world needs changing.
Because they care, they do more, give more, encourage more, help
more, guide more, mentor more, develop more, build more, and,
ultimately, accomplish more. If I had a dollar for every time I heard the
saying, “People don't care how much you know until they know how
much you care,” I would be rich. But the reason why people say it so
much is because it's true. When you care about someone, they know it
and feel it. And when they know you care about them, they will care
about you and follow you with loyalty and passion. Pat Summitt, the
legendary women's basketball coach at Tennessee, said, “I won 1,098
games and eight national championships, and coached in four different
decades. But what I see are not the numbers. I see their faces.” And her
players still talk about how she cared about the faces she saw. She
became a surrogate mother to hundreds of her players over the years—
players who became more like her daughters. What they remember most
about her was the way she cared about them and made time for them
and always had her office door open so they could walk in and sit down
and talk with her. One of her players, Candace Parker, said Summitt was
excited about winning championships but she was even more excited
about making a difference in the lives of her players.

Develop Your Caring Trademark
Great leaders have what I call a caring trademark, a unique way that
shows they care that causes them to stand out in their work and in the
world. If you've followed Derek Jeter's career and watched his
improbable game-winning hit in his final at bat in Yankee Stadium, you
know that Derek treated every at bat like it was his last, and that's what
made his last at bat so special. No one worked harder, played with more
passion, or cared more about his team and honoring the game of
baseball than “The Captain,” Derek Jeter. Jeter's hustle, passion, love of
his team, commitment, and work ethic have become his caring trademark
over the last 20 years.While Jeter always sprinted to first base and
treated every at bat as a sacred experience, Doug Conant's caring
trademark was writing over 10,000 thank-you notes to employees while
he was the CEO of Campbell Soup.
Drew Watkins, the superintendent of Prosper Independent School District
(ISD) in Texas, shows he cares more than any educator I've ever met. I
found out from his staff that he writes a personal note of congratulations
to every graduating senior. They mentioned it casually in conversation,
as if it was no big deal, but I quickly stopped in my tracks. “How many
graduates do you have this year?” I asked.“403,” they said. “He started
doing it when we had just 80 graduates in the district and keeps doing it
year after year no matter how much we grow. “I asked how he learns
about each student. “Does he get a report from the teachers in order to
write the notes?” “No,” they said. “He actually knows them. He personally
knows every student in the district. He's in the schools all the time, not
his office.” It was clear that he loves the students and they love him back,
as you can see from the big hug he received from a big graduate.

When Watkins and I had some time to chat, I asked what he's going to
do when he has 1,000 graduates. He told me he was going to keep doing
it. “The day I stop is the day I need to stop doing this job,” he said. “The
crime is not that the passion has run out. It's that you stuck around after it
has.” Watkins is, in no way, just sticking around. I found out that in
addition to writing notes to graduates he also sends each student in
Prosper ISD a note on their birthday. He can often be seen opening car
doors and greeting students in the car line each morning before school.
Sometimes he leaves messages of encouragement on whiteboards in the
classrooms while the teachers and students are at lunch. And every
Monday morning he sends all the educators and staff in the district an
email with words of wisdom, encouragement, and praise. I posted a
comment on Facebook about meeting Watkins, and the comments
flooded in.
A former student wrote:

A former student wrote:
I've known him since I was a kid in pre-k. He sat down with me at
lunch one day my junior year in high school and asked, “Still don't
like the crust?” meaning my sandwich which I had torn the crust off
from. For him to remember that I didn't like the crust all this time still
amazes me. I'm grateful to have had him for a superintendent,
couldn't have asked for a better one.
A few moms wrote:
“I'll never forget when my children were in kindergarten. They came
home talking about a ‘man’ that sat with them at lunch. Puzzled, I
was like ‘What man??!’ They quickly responded, ‘Mr. Watkins.’ I was
impressed six years ago and have continued to be, as I see him
opening car doors, greeting the kids in car line…sometimes in the
pouring rain.”
“He opened the car door for my son Jacob on his first day of
kindergarten and on his last day of his senior year and he
remembered!! Made me cry like a baby.”
A few teachers from Prosper ISD wrote:
“I love Dr. Watkins. Twelve years working for Prosper ISD, and he
has the same passion as the first day. Proud to be part of his staff.”
“Dr. Watkins is a leader by example. He shows the students, staff,
and the community of Prosper that he cares!!”
The overwhelming flood of responses showed how much people
appreciate a leader who cares and how we long for leaders to care. I left
Prosper ISD inspired by Drew Watkins to do more to show that I care. I
hope after reading this you feel the same way. Drew Watkins is a great
model for all of us. We can all care more, give more, and do more to
make a difference. We may not rise to the level of caring of Drew
Watkins, but we can strive to be more like him. We can all work to invest
in relationships and find ways to show people that we care about them.
When you show you care in your own unique way, you will stand out in a
world where many have seemed to forget to care. And when you care,
you inspire others to care. After all, think about all the great organizations
lead by positive leaders who are showing the world they care. A caring

leader unites, connects, encourages, and transforms teams and
organizations and changes the world.

The Sandwich
The first leader I ever met, the one who was my greatest coach and
encourager, the one who loved and served me and cared about me like
no other was my mom. She wasn't always positive to herself but she
taught me one of the greatest lessons in positive leadership. More than
10 years ago I was taking a walk with my mom near her home in South
Florida when I noticed she was getting tired. My mom and I always
walked together. She was a fit, walking machine and never got tired, so I
knew something was wrong. “Let's go back to the condo so you can rest,”
I said.
“No, I want to walk to the store so I can get some food to make you a
sandwich for your drive home.”
I was headed back to my home in Ponte Vedra Beach and my mom
thought I might starve to death without eating during the five-hour drive.
Her caring trademark was cooking for me. We continued walking, made it
to the supermarket, and, as we walked back, I could tell she was getting
more and more tired. When we arrived back at her condo she was
exhausted, and yet the first thing she did was walk into the kitchen to
make me a sandwich. On my drive home, I ate her sandwich but didn't
think much about it at the time. Now, over 10 years later, I think about
that sandwich a lot because it was the last time I saw my mom fully
conscious. My mom was battling cancer, which was why she was so
tired. She didn't tell me how bad it really was, nor did she mention how
bleak the odds were for her survival. She was fighting for her life and, yet,
on that day, her biggest priority was to make me a sandwich. Looking
back I realize she wasn't just making me a sandwich. She was showing
me what selfless love and positive leadership are all about. At her
funeral, many of her real estate clients and colleagues came up to me
and shared countless stories of all the selfless acts of love my mom did
for them as well. It turns out she served her team at work and her clients
the same way she served her family. We often think that great leadership
is about big visions, big goals, big actions, and big success. But I learned

from my mom that real positive leadership is about serving others by
doing the little things with a big dose of selfless love. Many want to be
big-time leaders but it's important to remember that being a big-time
leader starts with doing the little things to serve those you lead. It's
always about the little things. Unity, relationships, and teamwork are
developed slowly, one day; one interaction; one moment; one loving,
serving, and caring act at a time.

CHAPTER 9
POSITIVE LEADERS PURSUE EXCELLENCE
People think you have to choose between positivity and winning.
You don't have to choose. Positivity leads to winning.
Positive leaders care about others and are optimistic about the future, so
they are always looking for ways to make it better. They are always
looking for ways to transform what is into what could be. They are never
satisfied with the status quo and as a result are always striving to
improve themselves, their teams, their organizations, and the world. They
pursue excellence, build greatness, and often try to accomplish the
impossible. These efforts are not for the faint of heart. They require
passion, humility, grit, confidence, drive, and an uncommon desire to be
ones best and bring out the best in others. Positive leaders make their life
and work a quest for excellence. When they wake up, they ask
themselves, “How can I get better to make the world better?” A positive
leader on a quest for excellence is significant because one positive
leader in pursuit of excellence raises the standards and performance of
everyone around them.

Humble and Hungry
Positive leaders are humble and hungry. They don't think they know it all.
They are life-long learners who are always seeking ways to learn,
improve, and grow. They are always open to new ideas and strategies to
take their life and work to the next level. They live with humility, knowing
that the minute they think they've arrived at the door of greatness is the
moment it will get slammed in their face. They are also hungry with a
passion and burning desire to continuously improve and grow. They are
willing to put in the sweat and tears, commitment and years in order to
help their teams and organizations accomplish great things. Matt Ryan,
the quarterback of the Atlanta Falcons, is a great example of humble and
hungry. Every time I spoke to the team during training camp, he was
always sitting in the front row to the left and would always come up to me

afterwards and ask me a question about something I shared. He wasn't
motivated by a paycheck. He had already signed a $100 million contract.
He was always looking for even the smallest way to improve and get
better as a quarterback and leader, and it's why he continues to improve
every year.
Positive leaders never stop learning and growing and improving. I
remember speaking at a leadership conference in Dallas and looking
over to the left in the front row and seeing Zig Ziglar, the legendary
motivational speaker sitting there. I ran over to him and said, “Zig, one of
the big goals in my life was to meet you.”
He said, “You need to have bigger goals.”
He was still funny after all those years. While speaking, I looked over and
saw Ziglar taking notes. At 82 years old, he was taking notes. Not
because I was up there. Anybody could have been up there and he
would have been taking notes. He was humble and hungry. He only lived
a few more years after that but I'll always remember how he spent the
last few years of his life—still improving. I love what Pablo Casals, the
famous cellist, said when asked why he continued to practice the cello at
the age of 90. He said, “Because I think I'm making progress.”

There Is No Finish Line
While having lunch with George Raveling, the legendary Hall of Fame
college basketball coach, I learned that after three decades of coaching
he worked in broadcasting for a few years before joining Nike at the age
of 62 years old as their director of global basketball sports marketing.
While most people are getting ready to retire, George said working at
Nike was like going to Harvard Business School. He learned more in the
last 18 years of his life than the previous 52 years. At 80 years old
George reads 50 books a year and asks himself often, what do I need to
know that I don't know? What do I need to unlearn to learn? Each day his
goal is to be a positive difference in as many people's lives as possible. I
asked George if he would ever retire. He said, “I've thought about it but
then what would I do?” He's already mentored and impacted countless
coaches, players, and people but he's still not done making a difference.
Reiterating one of Nike's tag lines he said, “There is no finish line.” At 80
he's still learning, growing, and improving. So can you at any age. Keep

he's still learning, growing, and improving. So can you at any age. Keep
learning. Keep improving. Keep helping others. Keep making a positive
impact. There is no finish line.

Demanding without Being Demeaning
Many think that positive leaders are nice, undisciplined, happy-go-lucky
people who smile all the time and believe that results are not important.
But this couldn't be further from the truth. Positive leaders are demanding
without being demeaning. They both challenge and encourage their
teams and organizations to continue to improve and get better. Being a
positive leader doesn't mean you don't have high expectations. The
greatest positive leaders I have met, such as Alan Mulally, have very high
expectations. You don't transform a company losing $14 billon into a
profitable business in a few years without high expectations. However, he
provided the encouragement, process, system, and coaching to meet
these expectations. Pete Carroll, coach of the Seattle Seahawks, is
known for creating a culture where his team has a lot of fun but he's also
one of the most competitive people you'll ever meet. His belief that
competition makes you better is a huge part of the Seattle Seahawks
DNA, and they are passionate about always improving and winning.

Love and Accountability
I've worked with and studied leaders for years and I believe that the
positive leaders who are able to create amazing teams and results
provide both a lot of love and a lot of accountability. Love and
accountability. That is how great teams, organizations, relationships, and
results are created. If I had to pick the most important section of the book
it would be right here: Alan Mulally, for example, told me that you have to
love your people, but you have to make sure you hold your team
accountable to the plan, the process, the principles, and the values of the
culture. Alan told me that while his leadership approach and
management system includes bringing everyone in the company
together, respect, helping and appreciating each other, having fun, and
enjoying the journey, it's also about a relentless implementation of the
plan. It's about having clear performance goals and making sure

everyone knows the goals and knows the data, status, and progress
towards those goals. It's making sure everyone knows the plan and what
needs special attention. If you are having a problem, that's okay, but
don't keep it a secret. Let's figure it out together and find a solution. If you
are failing in some way, you won't be ostracized, but rather you will find
the support you need to succeed. Yet, Alan said there is zero tolerance
for violating the process. If you are not willing to work with others on the
plan, then Ford is probably not the right fit for you. Alan said his numberone job was to be a keeper of the culture and hold his team accountable
to the principles, values, process, and behaviors. He said if someone
violates the process and you don't address it, then everyone knows you
aren't committed to it. If you don't hold people accountable to it, your
team won't live and breathe it. But when you love people and hold them
accountable, it's amazing how fast things can move in the right direction.
When Alan took over Ford, his leadership team didn't know if he was for
real and many people didn't buy into his approach at first. But Alan was
steadfast in his principles and process. He held his team accountable to
the process and his expectations and, as a result, he quickly earned their
trust and respect, and teamwork improved swiftly.
Dabo Swinney is one of the best I've ever seen at providing both love
and accountability, and it's one of the key reasons for their recent
success and prominence. When you spend time with him and his
program, you can feel the love he has for his players. They know it. But
they also know that he's there to make them better and hold them
accountable to the standards they have set at Clemson. Clemson is like a
big family with a lot of love and also a lot of structure and discipline.
When one of his star players violated team rules, Dabo wouldn't let him
play the first game of the season against Auburn, a very good team.
Although it wasn't a big violation, and most teams would have let the
player play, Dabo told me, “We have to hold everyone accountable to the
standards we have set, and if I let him play what does that say to our
players, our staff, our university, and our fans? We have our values and
we must live them.” People tried to convince him otherwise but he stuck
to his guns and they won the game without their star player. That was
five years before Clemson would win a National Championship. To
understand how important the culture, values, and process are to Dabo,
he has a book about 18 inches thick with ideas, principles, beliefs,

cultural values, and other notes that he reviews with his coaching staff
during a four-day retreat before the season. Every year, for four full days,
Dabo goes through the book, page by page, with his staff. He said, “You
can't assume they know it or remember it. You can't forget all the little
things that made and make you successful. You have to go back to the
basics and that's what we do for four full days. This book represents the
foundation of what we are all about and we commit to it. Then we love
our players and hold them accountable to it.” Love without accountability
means you'll have great relationships and be a loving family, but you
won't be a great team. On a great team, each player makes the others
better. Everyone strives for excellence together and accomplishes great
things together. If you have accountability without love, you won't have
real commitment, buy-in, loyalty, passion, or great teamwork. You'll be
more like a dysfunctional family that fights all the time and simply tries to
survive each day but doesn't thrive. Eventually the rules will lead to
rebellion and the pressure and stress without support will lead to burnout.

Love Tough
The difference between a positive leader and other leaders is that many
leaders focus on accountability first and love comes later or not at all.
Many talk about tough love and I believe in it, but I have found that love
must come first. If your team knows you love them, they will allow you to
challenge and push them. Instead of tough love, it needs to be love
tough. My friend Buzz Williams, who is the head basketball coach at
Virginia Tech, loves his players and invests in them so much that he
earns the right to push them beyond their comfort zone to be their best.
He helps them become better than they ever thought possible because
he's all about love tough. John Calipari is the same way. And so is
Stephanie White, Christina Halfpenny, Brad Stevens, Mike Matheny, and
Clint Hurdle—so are all the positive leaders who make the greatest
impact. When you think about it, it's not a nice way to lead, but rather it's
the way to lead, because when you love someone you want to help them
improve. It means you challenge them to reach their full potential. You
don't let them settle for anything but their best. Your team may not like
you for it now, but they will appreciate you for it later. I tell this to my
teenagers all the time because they are the beneficiaries of my love

tough leadership. And I know from experience that your team won't hate
you if your love comes first. They may not like it but they will know you
love them and want the best for them.

Craftsmen and Craftswomen
Positive leaders help their team become craftsmen and craftswomen
instead of carpenters. There's a difference between a carpenter and a
craftsman. A carpenter just builds something but a craftsman puts in
more time, energy, effort, and care to build a work of art. Instead of just
showing up and going through the motions, a craftsman works to build
masterpieces. In a world where too many settle for mediocrity, craftsmen
and craftswomen seek to create excellence and build greatness. They
care more and, because they care more, they invest more—more energy,
effort, sweat, tears, and years mastering their craft. While speaking to an
MLB baseball team in their locker room I asked them how many believed
they could work harder than they already were. Everyone raised their
hands. Then I said, “So what's the next question?”
They answered “Why aren't you?”
We discussed it and decided that to work harder, you have to care more.
If you care more, you will put your heart, soul, spirit, and passion into it to
accomplish more. If you care more about your project, work, and craft
than about all the distractions vying for your attention, you won't allow
those distractions to get in the way. You will invest your energy into
building something meaningful that lasts. Positive leaders and their
teams care more and, as a result, they create more masterpieces.
In Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs, he shared a story about
Jobs as a young boy helping his father build a fence. His father told him
he must care about crafting the back of the fence as much as the front.
When Steve asked why the back mattered when no one would see how it
was crafted, his father said, “But, you will know.” Steve's father taught
him to care more and, years later, he went on to create Apple products
with such care that they generated feelings of awe, loyalty, and passion
among the brand's millions of new customers. It wasn't an accident.
Jonathan Ive, the man who has designed many iconic Apple products,
said, “We believe our customers can sense the care we put into our
products.” Apple cared about the work they did and the products they

products.” Apple cared about the work they did and the products they
created and, in turn, their customers cared about them. I know Steve
Jobs wasn't considered very positive by most who worked with him, and
some would argue that he wouldn't be considered a positive leader.
Please keep in mind that no one is a perfect positive leader and not
everyone has every trait discussed in this book. From all accounts, Jobs
fell short in his ability to develop relationships, but his vision, mission,
optimism, pursuit of excellence, and desire to change the world were
unmatched, and that's why I am sharing what he did. He was a craftsman
who cared more, and I believe it was his passion that attracted people to
him and inspired them to be craftspeople who created masterpieces that
changed the world.

The One Percent Rule
It's a simple rule I share with leaders and teams to help them create
excellence. The rule says to give one percent more time, energy, effort,
focus, and care today than you gave yesterday. Each day give more than
you did the day before. Obviously you can't calculate one percent, but
you can push yourself more today than you did yesterday. You can
improve and get better today. You can strive for excellence and work to
become your best. You can tune out distractions and focus even more on
what matters most. I've had one team with 35 people implementing the
one percent rule. They said if each person gives one percent more each
day that's 35 percent daily and, over time, this extra percent will produce
big results. It did. They had incredible growth by pursuing both individual
and team excellence.

Clarity and Action
Excellence is what positive leaders strive for, but you can't achieve
excellence without clarity and action. Positive leaders provide the clarity
that leads to focused action. This was never more clear to me than when
Alan Mulally shared several images with me before our conversation.
One image included his Working Together management system,
principles, and practices that are a list of 11 expected ideals, such as
“people first,” “everyone is included,” and “clear performance goals.” The

second image featured Mulally's Creating Value Roadmap process,
which shared the process and strategy he and his team and organization
would utilize to work together to relentlessly implement the plan. Every
key part of the process and plan were all contained in one image that
provided the clarity of vision, process, focus, and plan. The third image
Mulally shared was also Ford's Creating Value Roadmap process. This
time he had designed it for Ford. On a two-sided plastic card that was
shared with everyone in the company, Mulally included the vision,
strategy, and plan: One Ford. One team. One plan. One goal. Mulally
said that everyone needs to know the plan, embrace the plan, and trust
the process. Then you love ‘em up and let them take action. When I
spoke with Mulally, he said everything he did was based on these three
images, which everyone knew, understood, and embraced. I immediately
saw the genius in his approach and management system. Everything
everyone needed to know was right there in front of them in a card they
could hold in their hand. They didn't have to search the company website
for it or read a 200-page book. Everyone had the plan, knew the plan,
and understood the process. Mulally provided such clarity that it enabled
and empowered everyone in the company to take action. There was no
ambiguity creating hesitancy, or clutter slowing people down. Instead,
there was organizational unity, operational discipline, and focused action
day after day, week after week, that over time produced incredible
results.
As a leader, don't fall into the trap that the idea or plan has to be
complicated to work. Simple is powerful. Clarity leads to focus and action.
Action leads to results. You can be the most positive leader, but optimism
without action equals today's fantasy. Optimism plus clarity and action
equals tomorrow's reality. Through love and accountability, clarity and
action, and a relentless drive to improve and succeed, positive leaders
transform their quest for excellence into a better future for all.

CHAPTER 10
POSITIVE LEADERS LEAD WITH PURPOSE
We don't get burned out because of what we do. We get burned out
because we forget why we do it.
There will be days that you wake up and don't feel very positive. There
will be times your culture doesn't seem strong. There will be moments
you don't feel very positive about the vision of where you are going.
There will be meetings where the energy vampires seem like they have
the upper hand. There will be conversations where you don't feel like
communicating and connecting. There will be nights where you wonder
why you chose a leadership position at all. It's times like these where you
need a purpose to give you something to be positive about. Purpose
fuels positivity and is the reason why you overcome all the challenges
and keep moving forward. Purpose is why you wake up and want to
transform your team and organization and change the world. Without a
greater purpose, there's no great desire. Every great organization must
have a greater purpose for why they exist and every positive leader must
be driven by purpose to lead others and make a greater impact. Donna
Orender, for example, told me that her optimism to transform and
improve the PGA Tour and WNBA came from finding the greater purpose
that drives her motivation. Motivation doesn't last, but purpose-driven
motivation does. Trying to lead without purpose is like driving from New
York to California on a half a tank of gas. You'll be running on empty
before you know it. But knowing, remembering, and living your purpose is
like having a series of gas stations along the journey. You can fuel up
and keep moving forward.
People think that hard work is what makes us tired. Hard work doesn't
make us tired. A lack of purpose is what makes us tired. We don't get
burned out because of what do. We get burned out because we forget
why we do it. Research shows that more people die Monday morning at 9
AM than any other time. Think about it. People would rather die than go
to work. We live in a world where many are seeking happiness but they
are having trouble finding it. That's because happiness isn't an outside
job. It's an inside job. It doesn't come from the work you do but rather

job. It's an inside job. It doesn't come from the work you do but rather
from the meaning and purpose you bring to your work. That's why I want
to encourage you not to seek happiness. Live your passion and purpose,
and happiness will find you. Don't chase success. Instead, decide to
make a difference with a greater purpose, and success will find you.
Alan Mulally didn't transform Ford just because he created organizational
unity and operational discipline, and because everyone knew the plan,
embraced the plan, and worked toward the plan. He also transformed
Ford because he inspired everyone with a greater purpose. It was a
purpose that inspired Henry Ford from the very beginning, and it was to
open the highways to all of mankind. Alan simply had to remind everyone
in the company why they existed and then he had to live with purpose,
which he did in a big way, and inspire purpose in others. Alan was also
driven with purpose to make a significant contribution to the world and, by
saving Ford, an American icon, and saving tens of thousands of jobs and
contributing to the U.S. and global economies, he certainly did. As a
leader you need to know, remember, and live your why and inspire the
people on your team in your organization to do the same. When you are
driven with purpose you will inspire others to drive with purpose.

Find and Live Your Purpose
It starts with you and your purpose as a leader. Why do you lead? Why
do you do the work you do? If you don't have a purpose you can't share
it. I wrote a book, The Seed, about finding your purpose. Josh, the main
character, doesn't have a purpose. He meets a farmer who gives him a
seed and tells him to find out where to plant the seed. When he finds the
right place, he will find his purpose. Josh goes on a journey to plant his
seed, ultimately learning that he needs to plant the seed right where he
is. He discovers that when you plant yourself where you are and decide
to make a difference and live with purpose, your greater purpose starts to
reveal itself to you.
Tamika Catchings didn't become one of the all-time great leaders and a
WNBA basketball player simply because she worked hard. She became
one of the greatest because of her great desire to inspire people and
change the world through her sport. Rhonda Revelle didn't win more than
700 games as the softball coach at Nebraska just because she pursued

excellence. She did it because she was driven with purpose to make a
difference in the lives of her players off and on the field. The research
shows that people are most energized when they are using their
strengths for a bigger purpose beyond themselves.13 I can't tell you what
your purpose should be, but I can tell you that every one of us can find a
bigger purpose in the job we have. I met a mortgage broker at a
conference who told me that her job is to save marriages. “How do you
do that?” I asked, wondering how this was possible as a mortgage
broker. She said during the great recession we found that if people lost
their homes their marriage was more likely to fall apart. “So I made it my
mission to help people find ways to keep their home so they can keep
their marriage intact.” It's no surprise she was number one in her
company. I heard about a janitor who worked at NASA and, even though
he was sweeping floors, he felt his bigger purpose was contributing to put
a man on the moon. I met a bus driver who knows his purpose was to
help kids stay off drugs. I met an administrative assistant who has
become the chief energy officer of her company. I met an Atlanta Airport
Popeye's Chicken employee named Edith who makes thousands of air
travelers smile each day. I know my purpose is to inspire and empower
as many people as possible, one person at a time. We are all just
ordinary people with the power to live an extraordinary purpose. In any
job, your purpose waits for you to find it and live it.
A friend of mine who is a human resources executive at a children's
hospital told me that once a week she sits in the lobby of the hospital to
see the patients and their families and remind herself why the work she
does matters. If she didn't, she said, she would get lost in all of the
paperwork, HR issues, and distractions that seem far removed from the
core mission of helping to heal children. But by sitting in the lobby and
connecting to her purpose, she is able to do those mundane tasks
knowing she is contributing to the purpose of the hospital. Your job may
not be your ultimate purpose, but through your leadership you can use it
to be a vehicle to share your greater purpose. Most of all, remember that
if you are a leader, you have a purpose and it's to inspire others to live
theirs.

Share the Purpose

When I speak to leaders I encourage them to share a vision and purpose
in one statement. I believe they are stronger together. The vision is
where you are going. The purpose is why you are going there. Together,
they provide you with the fuel you need on your journey. As a leader, one
of the most important things you can do is share and remind the people
on your team and in your organization of the greater purpose of why you
exist. Why are you here? What difference can you make? What legacy
will you leave? If vision is the North Star, purpose is the fuel that powers
you to follow it. Everyone needs a North Star and everyone needs a
bigger and greater purpose. Alan Mulally told me he shared the vision
and purpose before every meeting. Steve Jobs may not have been big on
positivity, but he was driven with purpose and he shared that purpose
with everyone in Apple. The Pittsburgh Pirates told me their purpose is to
help their players become better men, and better men become better
baseball players. Everyone in the organization knows the purpose and
seeks to share it.

Inspire Others to Live Their Purpose
Sharing the purpose is important but it's futile unless it inspires purpose
in others. As a leader, you want to share the organizational purpose with
the purpose of inspiring others to join the mission and be on a mission.
You want to let everyone know why your organization exists and why
their work matters. Many think they have to work at a homeless shelter or
go to Africa to make a difference. They think they have to find meaning
and purpose outside their work. And while it's wonderful if they want to
volunteer for a charity or feel called to go on a mission trip, as a leader
you want to remind your team that you don't have to go on a mission trip
to be on a mission. You can bring your mission, passion, and purpose to
the work that you do each day. Tell your people that you may not build
libraries around the world, but you can find the bigger purpose in reading
to your children. You may not feed the homeless every day, but you can
nourish your employees and customers with a smile, kind word, and care.
And while you may not start your own nonprofit organization, you can
begin a charity initiative at work. After all, charity means “love in action.”
You can make a difference every day and touch the lives of everyone you
meet. While these people may not be starving because of a lack of food,

you can provide them with a different kind of nourishment that will feed
their souls and feed your own in the process.

Purpose-Driven Goals
One of the great ways I have discovered to help people to live with
purpose is to help them create purpose driven goals. For example, for
years I chose Organic Valley milk over other brands in the supermarket. I
had no idea why it appealed to me until I spoke at their remote
headquarters surrounded by acres of farmland in the middle of
Wisconsin. I discovered a company that didn't believe in sales and
revenue goals. Of course they forecasted sales for budgetary, planning,
and growth purposes, and measured numbers and outcomes, but they
did so with the belief that numbers were just a byproduct of how well they
were living and sharing their purpose. Instead of focusing on goals with
numbers, Organic Valley passionately focused on their purpose-driven
goals: providing opportunities for farmers to make a living; sustainability
of the land; and providing families with healthy dairy products that were
free of hormones and antibiotics. The result: Organic Valley's numbers
kept growing and growing. They had a mission people could taste.
While speaking to an NFL team a few years ago, I had each player write
their goals on a piece of paper. After a few minutes, I had them rip up the
paper they had just written on. (I was inspired by my friend Joshua
Medcalf's book Burn Your Goals, but didn't want to be the guy known for
causing a fire in an NFL meeting room, so I had them rip up the paper
instead.) You could hear the complaints and feel their anger and
frustration while they ripped up the paper they had just spent time and
energy writing on. I then asked, “How many of you wrote down win a
Super Bowl, win x number of games, achieve x number of yards, have x
number of interceptions, etc.?”All the hands went up. I told them that
every person in every NFL meeting room has the same goals. It's not the
goals that will make you successful. Otherwise everyone and every team
would be successful after writing down their goals. Instead, it's your
commitment to the process, your growth and your purpose that drives
you to reach these goals that will determine what you accomplish. I then
had them write down their commitments and purpose for playing and had

them share with the rest of the team. It was powerful.
The truth is that numbers and goals don't drive people. People with a
purpose drive the numbers and achieve goals. Research clearly shows
that true motivation is driven by meaning and purpose rather than
extrinsic rewards, numbers, and goals. A study of West Point alums
showed that those who had intrinsic goals, “I want to serve my country
and make a difference” outperformed those with extrinsic goals “I want to
rise in the ranks and become an officer because it's prestigious.” Goals
may motivate you in the short term but they will not sustain you over
time.14 Without a good reason to keep moving forward during challenges,
you either quit or go through the motions.
Now this doesn't mean you shouldn't measure numbers or have goals.
You need to measure the numbers. In many cases you need to have
revenue targets. Numbers are to your purpose what a scale and
measuring tape are to a diet. It's in indicator of how you are doing. In the
case of Ford, Alan Mually had clear performance goals that were a key
part of the plan and process. Every organization wants to surpass last
year's number. Every nonprofit wants to help more people. Every school
wants to empower more children. Every hospital wants to reduce patient
deaths and save more lives. It's great to have a goal you want to achieve,
but once you identify a goal or outcome, you will be more powerful and
energized if you are tapping into a bigger purpose in order to reach your
numbers and goals. Your greater purpose will lead to greater
performance! Yes, count the fruit, but know it's just a byproduct of how
well you are nurturing the root. Purpose-driven goals sell more milk, win
more games, enhance performance, and lead to outcomes that far
surpass your numbered goals alone.

One Word
A powerful and practical way to live with purpose throughout the year is
to pick a word for the year that will inspire you to live with more meaning
and mission, passion and purpose. My friends Dan Britton and Jimmy
Page have been doing this for over 20 years, and the words they choose
each year have shaped and inspired their lives in many ways. About six
years ago, they told me how each year they, along with their family

members, pick a word and, on New Year's Eve, each member of their
family makes a painting of their word. They put the paintings in the
kitchen as a reminder to live their word. I thought it was really powerful
and started doing it as well with my family, and then shared the idea with
the various leaders and teams I worked with. It was catalytic and life
changing. Leaders shared words with me like, “love” and “dream” and
“invest” and “go” and “execute” and “fearless” and “life” and
“relationships.” Dabo Swinney even said in the interview immediately
after winning the National Championship, “My word all year was love and
I told my team that their love for each other was going to make the
difference.” It's an idea that has taken off and now hundreds and
thousands of leaders and their teams pick a word each year to inspire
them at work and home. Hendrick Auto even created a one-word car in
their headquarters with all the words of all the employees on the car.
When employees walk into the building they see their words and are
reminded to live them. I've also had schools make one-word t-shirts and
create one-world walls, and businesses and hospitals post words in
meeting rooms and offices. When speaking about this idea, I ask people
to pick a word but also to identify why they choose it. It's the why behind
the word that gives it meaning and makes it a powerful, purpose
producer. It's also a powerful exercise for leaders to do with their teams.
Imagine if you and everyone you work with had a word for the year and
truly lived it. How much more powerful would you be? How much of a
greater impact would you make?

Life Word
In addition to choosing a word for the year I also encourage leaders to
select a Life Word. When the One Word concept took off, Dan, Jimmy,
and I, kept talking about ways to leave a greater legacy. While engaged
in a meaningful conversation one day, we asked each other, “What word
would you put on your tombstone?” We found it was a totally different
thought process than coming up with a yearly word. Dan chose passion.
Jimmy chose inspire. And I said positive because I know it's my life's
work and legacy. Then we wondered what words would capture the
essence and legacy of some of history's heroes. Perhaps Abraham
Lincoln's Life Word would have been unity. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s,

equality. Mother Teresa's compassion, Susan B. Anthony's vote. We
realized that if we could help people identify their Life Word, it would
inspire them to live their highest purpose and leave their greatest legacy.
We have taken a bunch of leaders through the process of finding a word
for the year and a Life Word, and it has been exponentially purposeful
and powerful. Think of each yearly word as a chapter in a book, and your
Life Word as the book's title. Together, they help you define and write
your life's story and leave and share your greatest legacy.

Leave a Legacy
Researchers conducted a study and they asked a group of 95-year-olds if
they could live their lives over again, what they would do differently. The
three things that almost all of them said were:
1. They would reflect more. They would enjoy more moments, more
sunrises, more sunsets, more moments of joy.
2. They would have taken more risks and chances. Life is too short not
to go for it.
3. They would have left a legacy, something that would have lived on
after they die.15
The most important legacies you will leave as a leader are people and a
world that have been impacted by your leadership, life, and presence. To
live a life of purpose, think about how you want to be remembered. Think
about what legacy you want to leave, because knowing how you want to
be remembered helps you decide how to live and lead today.
Tim Tebow is a great example of someone who is living his life to leave a
legacy. He could just be enjoying his celebrity but instead he's using his
fame and life to make a difference in the world through The Tim Tebow
Foundation. Tebow told me that when he was cut from the Broncos,
Eagles, and Jets, he didn't let it shake him because his identity was
rooted in something much greater than being a football player. He knew
his life's work wasn't just to be a great athlete but also to be a game
changer in life, and a life changer for others. Most people know him as a
Heisman Trophy winner pursuing his dream of being an NFL
quarterback, but what they don't know is that he's building greatness by

providing orphans in four countries with medicine, food, clothing,
education, and housing. Through his foundation, he builds Timmy's
Playrooms in children's hospitals, and provides medical care to countless
children who can't afford it through his Tebow Cure Hospital in the
Philippines. His foundation also creates an unforgettable prom night
experience, A Night to Shine, for teenagers with special needs. The
teenagers, who have to be 14 and older, walk into the event on a red
carpet while the crowd cheers as they enter the building. Inside they are
treated like kings and queens, with hair and makeup stations,
encouragement and love, and a fun night of dancing! Tebow Time used
to mean Tebow making plays on the field to help his team win, but now
it's all about Tebow using his time on earth to leave a legacy for others.

Give People Great Stories to Tell
Lisa Rose, the creator of First Fridays in Dallas, met a woman named
Deborah Lyons, who had created a program to help women and children
in abusive relationships to leave the situation and become independent.
Deborah had the program but needed the resources and a location to
make it happen. So Lisa recruited her husband Matt, the executive
chairman of BNSF Railway, to join her in this mission. Together they
raised enough money to build The Gatehouse, consisting of 96 luxurious
apartments on 60 acres of land in Grapevine, Texas, where they house,
feed, encourage, mentor, counsel, and invest in women and their children
who are escaping abusive situations. Residents, who are called
members, have to work in jobs outside the community while living there,
as they learn to provide for themselves, save money, and live
independently. The average stay is about two years. Lisa said it's a place
and a program for permanent change. “Everything we do is designed to
provide them with a safe and comfortable place and then our program is
designed to help them grow and create permanent change in their lives.
It's not a shelter. It's a community. It's not a hand out. It's a hand up.” I
asked her if she modeled it after another program and she said, “There
was nothing like it, so we had to create the model.” They don't seek
government funding. They raise all the money from businesses and
private donors.

When Lisa showed me around the community, the education center, the
chapel, the general store, the walking trails, and so on, she shared how
they were currently raising an endowment that would help fund their
yearly budget to ensure that The Gatehouse would continue long after
she and Matt were gone. I was blown away. They are not only investing
their lives to help people, but they are making sure they will still be
making a difference after their death. When I left The Gatehouse,
humbled by the experience, I couldn't help but think of all the children
and future children living there and how, when they are older, they'll be
telling their children stories about how Lisa, Matt, Deborah, and The
Gatehouse changed the course of their lives. You won't live forever, but
your impact on others lives on after you are gone. You don't have to build
a physical community like Lisa, Matt, and Deborah, but you can create a
community wherever you are. One's legacy is carried on through love
shared, lives touched, and stories told. The people you lead will be telling
stories about you years from now. You can't escape it. They will be telling
stories, so give people great stores to tell about you.

Life and Death
Nothing clarifies your purpose like a near-death experience. I don't
recommend one, but it does work. A few years ago my family and I were
on a plane from LAX Los Angeles heading to Atlanta. Shortly after taking
off and soaring above 10,000 feet, the plane abruptly slowed down and
the power went out as the pilot spoke over the sound system, “We're
experiencing a mechanical failure and heading back for an emergency
landing.” The next moment the plane descended so rapidly that my head
hurt and I thought we were going down. I looked at my wife and son, who
were sitting to the left and a few rows back because we couldn't get seats
together, and I saw the fear in my wife's eyes. I grabbed my daughter's
hand as she sat in the seat directly in front of me.
This can't be happening, I thought. We're not ready to die. I still have
three more books that I know I'm meant to write (this being one of them).
A few minutes later, the plane leveled off as I watched off-duty airline
employees, who were sitting in passenger seats, get up and run to the
back of the plane. The pilot announced that we were going to make the

emergency landing and to brace for impact. He said there would be
emergency vehicles there to meet us and that the flight attendants were
trained on what to do when we landed. While everything seemed eerily
calm and quiet, I couldn't stop thinking about the plane catching on fire or
splitting in two when we landed. Miraculously and thankfully, we made a
safe landing. The pilot said there was a fire in one of the engines, so he
descended rapidly to extinguish the fire in the same way that one
breathes to blow out a candle.
When we walked off the plane, my 14-year-old son put his arm around
me and said, “God's not done with us yet. It means we have more work
to do.” He was right. I left that experience more inspired than ever to live
my purpose and leave a legacy with my life. I had more work to do and, if
you are reading this, so do you. As a leader, you have more people to
inspire, help, encourage, mentor, love, serve, and care for. You have
more teams to lead and more people to impact. You have a world to
change because the world needs a leader like you to change it.

CHAPTER 11
POSITIVE LEADERS HAVE GRIT
The number one predictor and factor of success is not talent, title,
wealth, or appearance. It is grit!
Angela Duckworth's research at the University of Pennsylvania identifies
grit as the number-one predictor and factor of success. It's not talent,
title, wealth, or good looks. It's grit, the ability to work hard for a long
period of time towards a goal; to persevere, overcome, and keep moving
forward in the face of adversity, failure, rejection, and obstacles.16
Success doesn't happen overnight. Anything worthwhile takes time to
build. Along the way a leader will face countless challenges, failures, and
setbacks that will become roadblocks unless they find a way forward.
Positive leaders have grit and find a way to navigate the roadblocks or
run through them to move closer to their vision and goal.
When we look at successful companies and organizations, we see their
current success and prominence but what we don't see is the leadership
and grit that powered them through all the failure and moments of doubt,
heartache, fear, and pain. Everyone would now like to be Kevin Plank,
the CEO of Under Armour, but I'm guessing they wouldn't have wanted to
be him in 1995 when he was selling one product, a new highperformance t-shirt, from the basement of his grandmother's home in
Washington, DC, and financing his venture with a $40,000 loan from his
maxed-out credit cards. Everyone would love to enjoy the success Sara
Blakely, the owner of Spanx, has created, but I'm sure most wouldn't
want to sell fax machines door to door at the age of 25, or go to North
Carolina to visit most of the hosiery mills in the country to try to sell an
idea for a new kind of undergarment. Most of us wouldn't have continued
after being rejected by every representative. But she moved forward, and
eventually found a manufacturer who agreed to make her product
because her daughters thought it was a great idea. And with a lot of grit,
she was able to transform the pantyhose industry and become the
youngest self-made billionaire in history. Starbucks did not reach its fifth
store until 13 years into its history. Sam Walton did not open his second

store until seven years after starting his company. Pat Summitt, the
legendary women's basketball coach at Tennessee, didn't win her first
championship until her 13th year of coaching. Dabo Swinney and
Clemson lost 15 of their first 34 games and went 6–7 in 2010. Dabo
thought he was going to be fired but Clemson's athletic director at the
time, Terry Don Phillips, shared his continued belief in him. After that,
they won at least 10 games every year and a championship in 2016. And
John Wooden didn't win his first national title until his 16th season at
UCLA.
Whether you are attempting to turn around a company, grow a start-up,
build a winning team, or move a successful organization to the next level,
you can expect it to take time and perseverance. Duckworth says, “Grit is
passion and perseverance for long-term goals.” I would add that it's
actually a marathon and a series of sprints combined with a boxing
match. You are not just running but also getting hit along the way. Grit
keeps you moving forward through the sting of rejection, pain of failure,
and struggle with adversity. When life knocks you down, you may want to
stay down and give up, but grit won't let you quit. This begs the question,
“Why does grit keep you moving forward? How does it work? If grit drives
you, what drives grit?”

Know What You Want
I believe true grit starts with knowing what you truly want. When you
know what you want and you can see it, you will work hard and
persevere in order to achieve it. That's why having a vision for the road
ahead is so important. That's why we discussed the importance of a
leader carrying a telescope and microscope with them. When the world
doesn't see what you see and they think you are crazy for seeing it, your
vision of what you want and the grit to keep going must be greater than
all the negativity and naysayers. Sara Blakely said that she must have
gotten hundreds of NO's along the way, but that didn't stop her. She
knew what she wanted to create, believed in it, and kept working until
people finally saw what she saw and understood her brilliant idea.

Know Your Why

In the last chapter we discussed the power of purpose. Well, it not only
fuels positivity, but it also drives grit in a big way. When you know your
why, you won't let obstacles get in your way. When your purpose is
greater than your challenges, you won't give up. My dad was a New York
City police officer. Each day he left the house, my mom feared that he
wouldn't come home. He risked his life every day. Why? Was it the
paycheck? Not at all. He didn't make much but he worked for a bigger
purpose. When crime and my mom made him want to quit, he wouldn't.
He had a duty and a purpose to make New York a safer place, and that
kept him going.

Love It
If you don't love it, you'll never be great at it. If you don't love it, you won't
work to overcome all the challenges to keep doing it. If you love what you
do, you won't quit when the world says you should. You will continue to
show up every day, do the work, and discover that success is not created
by other people's opinions. It's not created by what the media and fearful
news says. It's not created by any of the circumstances outside you. It's
created by the love you have inside you—love for what you do, for your
team, for the organization you serve, and for the world you want to
change. The love and grit that you possess on the inside will create the
life you experience on the outside.
Love powers grit, and it also powers you over fear. I've heard it said that
fear is the second most powerful force in the universe because it's the
one thing that can keep us from our vision, goals, and dreams.
Thankfully, there's a force more powerful than fear, and it is love. People
think that fear is strong and love is weak, but love is more powerful than
fear. We don't run into burning buildings because of fear. We do it
because of love. Love is the antidote to fear. Love casts out fear so
where there is love, fear dissipates. When I speak to leaders, coaches,
and athletes, I encourage them to focus on the love of their work, craft,
and competition instead of their fear of failing. Fear is draining, but love is
sustaining. Fear causes you to worry about what everyone will think if
you fail. Love moves you to give your best and not worry about the rest.
A field-goal kicker I know in the NFL was struggling during his second

year after having a phenomenal rookie season. I reached out to him and
asked what was going on. He said he was thinking too much. I said tell
me about your rookie season. He said he was just thrilled to be in the
NFL. He was living his dream and loving kicking. I said tell me about this
year. He said he missed a few kicks in the pre-season and started to
worry about missing. He didn't want to let the coach and team down. He
didn't want to lose his job. I knew this problem well. Many people think
that the more success you have, the less fear you have but, actually, it
often works the other way. The more success you have, the more fear
you have because you have more to lose and further to fall. I encouraged
the field-goal kicker to get back to just loving the game, loving kicking,
and loving the process. I told him to look inside, not outside. Just kick.
Don't think. Just love it, don't fear it. He listened, was able to return to
love, and had a great rest of the season. It wasn't me. I just reminded him
what he already knew. I helped him to love it and, if you love it, you won't
fear it. Most of all, if you love the process, you'll love what the process
produces.

Embrace Failure
A big part of positive leadership and grit is knowing that you will fail along
the way but you don't allow failure to define you or stop you. Failure is a
big part of your path to success. It's not your enemy. It is your partner in
growth. It doesn't define you; it refines you. If you didn't fail, you wouldn't
build the character you need to succeed. When you have grit, you fail
and you move forward. You see it as an event, not a definition. You leave
the past and let it go. The path to greatness is never behind you. Just
keep moving forward. Failure and challenges are just part of the journey.
There's no accomplishment without struggle. No triumph without tests
and failures along the way. There would be no stories of positive leaders
changing the world if they didn't have to overcome adversity and failure in
order to do so. So the next time you fail, remember that George
Washington lost two thirds of all the battles he fought but won the
Revolutionary War. Abraham Lincoln suffered nine election defeats, the
death of a spouse, a nervous breakdown, and two bankruptcies before
becoming President of the United States. Oprah was told she wasn't fit
for television and was fired from her job as a news anchor. Walt Disney

was fired from a newspaper job for a lack of ideas. Dr. Seuss wanted to
burn the manuscript of his first book after it was rejected by 27
publishers. Steven Spielberg wasn't accepted to UCLA film school
because of average grades. Phil Knight was on the brink of bankruptcy
with Nike for over 10 years and routinely didn't know if the company
could make payroll. Steve Jobs was fired from Apple at age 30, and the
list goes on. You have to be willing to fail in order to succeed.

Keep Doing Things the Right Way: Trust the
Process
David Cutcliffe, the head football coach at Duke, told me that when the
team's record was 3–9 in 2010 and 2011 he felt optimistic because he
knew what he was building and knew that they were doing things the
right way. Then from 2012 to 2015 Duke made it to three straight
postseason bowl games. I've had similar conversations with my friends
and college lacrosse coaches John Tillman (Maryland), Jeff Tambroni
(Penn State), Kevin Corrigan (Notre Dame), and Nick Myers (Ohio State).
All of them have taken over programs and had to build them. The
common denominator is to keep doing things the right way, even when
the results aren't showing up yet. Don't focus on the numbers. Trust the
process. When you keep doing things the right way, eventually the
numbers will rise, the wins will come, and the outcome will happen.

Ignore the Critics; Do the Work
Positive leaders don't lead because they want recognition or enemies.
They lead because there is something they must do, build, create,
transform, and change. They lead because it's who they are and what
they are meant to do. However, with leadership comes scrutiny, praise,
critics, and attacks. A leader could find a cure for cancer and would still
have some people criticize them for it. There was even once a leader
who transformed the world by feeding the hungry, healing the sick, and
loving the unlovable, and yet he was killed for it. If you are a leader,
expect to be attacked. Positive leadership doesn't mean you won't be
criticized. It means you have the grit and belief to overcome it. Positive
leaders don't lead in a tranquil sea of positivity, but through the storms of

leaders don't lead in a tranquil sea of positivity, but through the storms of
adversity and negativity. Leadership is knowing that the critics will
criticize you while still saying what needs to be said and doing what
needs to be done. History doesn't remember the critic. It remembers the
one who withstood criticism to accomplish something great.
In our modern social-media–driven world, you will have more fans and
critics than ever. The keys are: Don't let praise go to your head and don't
let critics into your head. Be so invested in your craft that you don't have
time to listen to the naysayers. No time for negativity. You're too busy
creating the future. If I would have listened to the naysayers and critics, I
would have stopped working on my craft years ago. I want to encourage
you to never let the opinion of others define you and your future. Your
identity doesn't come from what the world says about you. It comes from
who you are on the inside. Your work, leadership, and mission are too
important to allow others to define your destiny.
No matter what anyone says, just show up and do the work.
If they praise you, show up and do the work.
If they criticize you, show up and do the work.
If no one even notices you, just show up and do the work.
Just keep showing up, doing the work, and leading theway.
Lead with passion.
Fuel up with optimism.
Have faith.
Power up with love.
Maintain hope.
Be stubborn.
Fight the good fight.
Refuse to give up.
Ignore the critics.
Believe in the impossible.
Show up.

Do the work.
You'll be glad you did.
True grit leads to true success.

CHAPTER 12
LEAD THE WAY FORWARD
The best is yet to come.
In this book I've shared stories of positive leaders who have transformed
their teams and organizations and changed the world. I've also shared
examples of positive leaders who are changing the world as we speak. In
a world where there seems to be more negativity than ever, what gives
me hope is that every week I meet and hear from new and emerging
positive leaders. They remind me that we don't have to settle for the
status quo and allow negative situations and circumstances to continue
and exist. We don't have to be stuck in a negative rut. We don't have to
allow negativity to rule our lives and our teams. Today we can decide to
address problems, find solutions, and find a way forward. I don't know
how old you are, where you are from, or anything about your career,
experience, title, challenges, or how many people you lead, but I do know
that today you can be the positive leader you were born to be. People
often ask me if leadership is nature or nurture. Are you born a leader or
can you develop into a leader? I believe you have everything you need
inside you to be a positive leader. Life and circumstances don't make you
into a leader. They reveal the leader you already are.
You don't have to change jobs to be a positive leader. You can be like
Tanya Walters, who was a school bus driver in Los Angeles. I met her
while speaking in California. One day, after realizing that most of her
students were failing in school, Tanya decided to challenge them to do
better. She challenged them to study harder, focus more, and improve
their grades. When they succeeded, she took them on a marine biology
cruise, which led to the idea of a summer bus trip around the country.
The purpose was to expose children to a world and life beyond the
toughest streets in Los Angeles. She succeeded and now, many trips
later, her non-profit, GodParents Youth Organization, has evolved into a
powerful mentoring and touring program that takes children to colleges
and historical sites around the country. It was even featured on Oprah.
Tanya could have just continued driving the bus and ignored the

challenges her students were facing. Instead, she chose to commit her
life and work to showing them the world, and she's changing lives in the
process. She chose to be a driver of positive change and instead of
letting the world influence her, she's a positive leader who is influencing
the world.
You can also be like Ursula, who was a pharmacy tech for a large
drugstore chain. She told me she was a single mom who had been
through a lot of hardships in her life but prided herself on her passion for
her job. However, after transferring to the roughest store in the city, her
passion quickly fizzled as she dealt with all the difficult customers and
negativity in the pharmacy. She was ready to throw in the towel, but
didn't want to leave a job she loved. After reading a few of my books, she
decided her purpose was “To provide selfless service to her coworkers
and customers and to make it a fun and uplifting environment.” She said
she brought in a huge pot of queso dip just because it was so good and
everyone loved it. Then she and her team started listening to upbeat
music and the atmosphere—as well as everyone's attitudes—changed
instantly. She said, “It was so fun! The difficult customers I used to dread
serving are now opportunities for me to shine. My goal is to make sure
they leave my presence with a smile on their face. I help my coworkers at
every chance I get and I make sure I try to lift them up with
encouragement and compliments. I even leave little gifts for them, like a
compliment on a sticky note for the new guy or a little picked flower for
another single mom. I am loving my job again, I'm living in the moment,
and my passion is back!” Ursula didn't need to change her job. She just
needed to change her attitude, and in the process she changed everyone
around her.
You don't have to continue living life in a negative rut. You can be like me
and so many of the people I have met who have gone from negative to
positive. My friend Rachel, for example, wouldn't stop complaining to me
at a party. For 20 minutes she bombarded me with a series of
complaints. She complained about her job. She complained about her
company's new policies. She complained about the economy. Most of all
she complained about her lack of sales. I wanted to say something but I
couldn't get a word in. Finally I stopped her and told her she had a
choice. “You can accept your company's new policies, come to work with

a positive attitude, and decide to be your best every day or you can find a
new job at a new company. But whatever you do, stop complaining
because it's not doing you any good.” The conversation was over and so
was our friendship, I thought, because Rachel wouldn't speak to me for a
few months. Then my wife and I saw her at the grocery store and she told
me that while it was hard to hear what I had to say, she had decided to
take my advice. She stayed in her job, stopped complaining, and started
selling more. Three months after changing her attitude, her sales were up
30 percent. A year later, her sales were up 70 percent. Three years after
our initial conversation, I caught up with Rachel again. We hadn't spoken
in a long time and I was wondering how she was doing. Rachel told me
that during the last two years her sales continued to grow. She has been
promoted twice and is now in her dream job, leading a division at her
company. It's the job she always wanted and she's more excited and
passionate than ever about her work. Rachel stopped whining and
started winning!
Andy Green was a young third-base coach for the Arizona
Diamondbacks, but because of the way he invested in relationships with
his players, worked hard, served others, and led with optimism and belief,
he caught the eye of the owners and general managers of other teams
and was hired to be the manager of the San Diego Padres. Andy said he
wasn't always about other people. As a young baseball player, he was all
about his own career advancement, but after being released by the
Cincinnati Reds, he told his wife that if he ever got the opportunity to play
Major League Baseball again, it would be about others and not himself.
He got another shot to play in the big leagues with the Mets and he
became a leader in the clubhouse and eventually a minor league
manager, where he won back-to-back Manager of the Year awards
before joining the Diamondbacks as a coach. Andy's career highlight
wasn't his major-league debut or game-winning home run, but rather
knocking on one of his minor league players' hotel room door at one
o'clock in the morning and telling him that he was going to the big
leagues for the first time. The player cried like a baby, Andy hugged him
and years later Andy said so far he hasn't had a better highlight than that.
I spoke to Andy's team last year and his players told me he's genuine,
caring, selfless, and always looking for ways to help them improve in
baseball and life. He's a positive leader who decided to make a

difference wherever he was and, as a result, he's now leading at the
highest level of his profession. I've worked with countless coaches who
have been hired, promoted, and built great careers and teams because
of their positive leadership. Some were already positive leaders. Some
became positive leaders and it made all the difference.
While you don't have to leave your job to be a positive leader, for some
people it does require a change in location, career, and calling. You may
have to leave the old behind in order to create the new. Niki Spears was
a principal of a school in Fort Bend when she reached out to me and said
she wanted to take The Energy Bus message to schools around the
world and create an Energy Bus for Schools program. Over the years I
have had a number of people approach me about this idea, but once they
realized the commitment it would take to make it happen, their
enthusiasm gave way to reality and they decided against moving forward.
I wanted to see it happen because I had a vision for it but knew it would
take the right person. When Niki approached me I thought she would be
like the others and fade away, but she didn't. She shared the same vision
and was so committed to it that she left her job as a principal with no
guarantee of success or a salary, and has since created a movement of
Energy Bus Schools that are transforming negativity in schools and
helping develop positive leaders for the future. I've watched her grow
from a principal of one school to now a leader of leaders who is helping
tens of thousands of educators and students improve and grow. She
tapped into the power of positive leadership and now she's transforming
the lives of principals, teachers, students, and their families. She's still an
educator. She's just educating many schools and classrooms instead of
one.
You may have to leave everything behind to become the leader you are
meant to be. You may be like Scott Harrison, who was a night club
promoter, drank heavily, smoked two packs of cigarettes a day, often
woke up hungover, and was one of the top club promoters in New York
City. Scott was at the top of his game, but one day he realized he was
playing the wrong game. He didn't want to rally people to meet at bars.
He wanted to unite people to make a difference. That ultimately led to
visits to Africa, where he discovered that each day 1,400 children die
from diseases caused by unsafe water and poor sanitation. Scott learned

that women and children will walk miles, sometimes taking half a day, to
find drinking water when there's fresh, clean water available in the
ground right under their feet in their village. All that's needed is a well to
extract the water and the funds to install it. Scott created Charity Water to
fill this need, and he started rallying many of his friends he met through
his years promoting nightclubs. Early on, Scott was having trouble raising
money to keep the non-profit running, and he refused to use money he
had raised to install water wells on operations. He was a few weeks away
from closing down Charity Water when a donor gave him a million dollars
to keep it going for another year. Scott said that at the time he thought
the money was what kept him going but, looking back, he realizes it was
the belief. Now, years later, instead of watching people get drunk, he's
providing people around the world with water to drink—and saving lives
and transforming communities in the process. To date, Charity Water has
helped provide 7 million people with clean drinking water and continues
to help provide water to 2,700 new people every day.
Yes, there's a lot of negativity in the world. Yes, there are many problems
that haven't been solved yet. But instead of focusing on all that's wrong,
you can realize that this is your time to make things right. With all the
negativity in the world, what a great opportunity you have to be a positive
leader and influencer. With all the technology and resources, there's
never been a better time to make a positive difference. When Alan
Mulally was contemplating becoming the CEO of Ford, despite all the
extreme challenges the company was facing, he did his homework and
knew all the daunting tasks that lie ahead, but he didn't run from it. When
writing notes to himself about the prospect of becoming the CEO of Ford
and turning it around, he wrote, “Wow. What fun!” He knew it was a big
problem that only a great leader could solve and he was up to the task to
try.
Your circumstances might be difficult and daunting and so were Austin
Hatch's. He was a rising star in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with a scholarship
to play basketball at Michigan when, while flying with his dad and
stepmother on a private plane, the plane crashed. His father and
stepmother were both killed and Austin suffered life-threatening injuries
and brain trauma. He was in a coma for a month. It was a horrible
tragedy made worse by the fact that Austin had lost his mother and two

siblings in another crash that he and his father had survived years before.
Austin has the rare distinction of being someone who has survived two
plane crashes. The odds of this happening are 11 quadrillion, 5 trillion to
one. Yet as miraculous as this was, the doctors believe it was even more
miraculous that Austin not only walked again but graduated high school,
attended Michigan, and joined the basketball team, which honored his
scholarship. Austin can't play like he used to, but his leadership is a huge
asset to his coach and Michigan teammates. While talking to Austin on
the phone recently, he told me about not letting circumstances define
him. He said he made a decision in the hospital while trying to walk again
that he would do whatever it took to walk out of that hospital. He said he
wanted to be a miracle for others. He said, “My life is only a miracle if I
can be a miracle to others.” And now, as a sophomore at Michigan, he's
finding time between studying and basketball to share and inspire others
with his message. He's living to be a miracle for others and so can you.
Nick called me a few days ago. He's a young man in the insurance
business. We've actually never met. I spoke to his company's leadership
last year and his boss told me about him and how he was struggling, and
I said I would call and encourage him. I called him and he was a really
nice young man just going through a lot of internal struggles. I had him
read one of my books and then said we would talk about what he had
learned. We did this once a month for a few months and then I didn't hear
from him for a while. When he called me the other day out of the blue he
told me about the holidays and how his positive attitude had helped him
have a great time with his family. He said where there used to be strife
with his siblings there was now meaningful conversation and connection.
He said because he had changed, everything around him seemed to
change, including his career, which is thriving. Most significant of all, Nick
told me that his best friend's dad had died, but because Nick had grown
as a leader, he was able to be there for his friend and help him through
this difficult time. “That would never have happened last year,” he said. “I
would have fallen apart and everyone would have had to help me. But
now I was able to help him.” Nick was able to be a miracle to his friend
and family.
That's how it works. Your one decision to be a positive leader will not
only impact your life, but your relationships, your family, your friends, and
your team. A life touches a life that touches a life. A person changes and

your team. A life touches a life that touches a life. A person changes and
they help others change. A leader inspires others and develops more
leaders. The seed you plant today becomes the harvest you enjoy
tomorrow. You may not see the harvest but don't let that stop you from
planting the seeds. There are seeds to plant, lives to change, teams to
transform, problems to solve, and a world to change. When you become
a positive leader, you will not only make yourself better, but you will also
make everyone around you better—and that's a great place to start!
